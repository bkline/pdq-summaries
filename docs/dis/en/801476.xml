<DrugInformationSummary id="CDR0000801476"><DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoType>Brief</DrugInfoType><DrugInfoAudience>Patients</DrugInfoAudience><DrugInfoDescription>Pemigatinib works by blocking the activity of abnormal FGFR2 proteins that signal cancer cells to divide. This keeps cancer cells from growing and may kill them. It may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Pemigatinib is a type of targeted therapy drug called a kinase inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily).                                                  </DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/pemigatinib">Pemigatinib</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000770381">pemigatinib</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000801467">pemigatinib</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Pemazyre</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>PEH-mih-GA-tih-nib</TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000802704" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000802705" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=9e1f2222-1d89-4e63-989c-ccebe2ab1eb4&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Pemigatinib</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=9e1f2222-1d89-4e63-989c-ccebe2ab1eb4&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_1"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
