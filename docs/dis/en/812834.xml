<DrugInformationSummary id="CDR0000812834"><DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoType>Brief</DrugInfoType><DrugInfoAudience>Patients</DrugInfoAudience><DrugInfoDescription>Glofitamab-gxbm works by bringing healthy T cells (immune cells that help kill cancer cells) and lymphoma cells close together so the T cells can more effectively kill the lymphoma cells. It does this by binding to a protein called CD3 on healthy T cells and a protein called CD20 on B cells (the immune cells that are cancerous in B-cell lymphomas). Glofitamab-gxbm is a type of immunotherapy drug called a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE). </DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/glofitamab-gxbm">Glofitamab-gxbm</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000792571">glofitamab-gxbm</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000812814">glofitamab</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Columvi</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>gloh-FIH-tah-mab</TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000814036" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000814037" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=3516e753-f064-4d30-9bd5-e3f2e143f75d&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Glofitamab-gxbm</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=3516e753-f064-4d30-9bd5-e3f2e143f75d&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_1"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
