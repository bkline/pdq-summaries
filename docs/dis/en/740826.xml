<DrugInformationSummary id="CDR0000740826"><DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoType>Brief</DrugInfoType><DrugInfoAudience>Patients</DrugInfoAudience><DrugInfoDescription>Regorafenib works by blocking proteins that signal cancer cells to divide. It also blocks proteins that signal the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Blocking these signals keeps cancer cells from growing and spreading to other parts of the body. Regorafenib is a type of targeted therapy drug called a kinase inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily). </DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/regorafenib">Regorafenib</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000595192">regorafenib</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000740896">regorafenib</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Stivarga</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>REH-goh-RA-feh-nib</TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000742082" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000742081" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=824f19c9-0546-4a8a-8d8f-c4055c04f7c7&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Regorafenib</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=824f19c9-0546-4a8a-8d8f-c4055c04f7c7&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_1"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
