<DrugInformationSummary id="CDR0000502250"><DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoType>Brief</DrugInfoType><DrugInfoAudience>Patients</DrugInfoAudience><DrugInfoDescription>Tamoxifen citrate is a type of hormone therapy called a selective estrogen receptor modulator (or SERM). It works by binding to estrogen receptors, blocking estrogen’s effects in some tissues while mimicking its effects in others. In breast tissue, tamoxifen citrate blocks estrogen from binding to its receptors, which may prevent the growth of cancer cells. Tamoxifen citrate mimics estrogen’s effects in bone tissue, which may reduce bone resorption and turnover and increase bone mineral density. </DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/tamoxifencitrate">Tamoxifen Citrate</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000042901">tamoxifen citrate</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000509341">tamoxifen citrate</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Soltamox</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>tuh-MOK-sih-FEN SIH-trayt</TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000718614" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000718613" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?labeltype=all&amp;query=tamoxifen+citrate&amp;pagesize=20&amp;page=1">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Tamoxifen Citrate</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?labeltype=all&amp;query=tamoxifen+citrate&amp;pagesize=20&amp;page=1">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_1"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
