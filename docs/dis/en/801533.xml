It consists of a monoclonal antibody linked to a toxic drug called SN-38 that binds to a protein on the surface of some cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cancer cells and blocks an enzyme called topoisomerase I. This damages the DNA of the cancer cells and kills them.</DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/sacituzumabgovitecan-hziy">Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000736415">sacituzumab govitecan-hziy</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000801485">sacituzumab govitecan</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Trodelvy</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>SAK-ih-TOO-zoo-mab GOH-vih-TEE-kan</TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000802715" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000802716" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=57a597d2-03f0-472e-b148-016d7169169d&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=57a597d2-03f0-472e-b148-016d7169169d&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_12"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
