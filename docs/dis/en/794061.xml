<DrugInformationSummary id="CDR0000794061"><DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoType>Brief</DrugInfoType><DrugInfoAudience>Patients</DrugInfoAudience><DrugInfoDescription>Ivosidenib works by blocking an abnormal enzyme that some cancer cells with specific changes in the IDH-1 gene make. Blocking the abnormal enzyme may make cancer cells differentiate to become more like normal cells and grow more slowly. Ivosidenib is a type of targeted therapy drug called an enzyme inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily). </DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ivosidenib">Ivosidenib</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000758551">ivosidenib</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000794063">ivosidenib</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Tibsovo</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>I-voh-SIH-deh-nib </TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000796167" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000796166" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=5b6d8ae8-bac8-4e1b-b1b4-7f9665e62de5">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Ivosidenib</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=5b6d8ae8-bac8-4e1b-b1b4-7f9665e62de5">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_1"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
