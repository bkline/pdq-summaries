<DrugInformationSummary id="CDR0000817079"><DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoType>Brief</DrugInfoType><DrugInfoAudience>Patients</DrugInfoAudience><DrugInfoDescription>Obecabtagene autoleucel works by changing a person's T cells (a type of immune cell) so they can better recognize and kill cancer cells. T cells are collected from the patient's blood and in the lab a receptor is added to them that targets a protein called CD19 found on B cells. B cells are the immune cells that are cancerous in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The modified T cells are grown in large numbers in the lab and then infused back into the patient. Once inside the body, obecabtagene autoleucel binds to the CD19 protein on cancer cells, helping the immune system kill the cancer cells. Obecabtagene autoleucel is a type of immunotherapy called CAR T-cell therapy.</DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/obecabtagene-autoleucel">Obecabtagene Autoleucel</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000801949">obecabtagene autoleucel</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000817081">obecabtagene autoleucel</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Aucatzyl</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>OH-beh-KAB-tuh-jeen AW-toh-LOO-sel</TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000817789" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000817790" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=4fef6986-b988-45e4-8c20-b14f0ef1f538&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Obecabtagene Autoleucel</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=4fef6986-b988-45e4-8c20-b14f0ef1f538&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_1"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
