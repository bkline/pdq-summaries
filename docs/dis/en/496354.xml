<DrugInformationSummary id="CDR0000496354"><DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoType>Brief</DrugInfoType><DrugInfoAudience>Patients</DrugInfoAudience><DrugInfoDescription>Capecitabine is a type of chemotherapy called an antimetabolite, which is a drug that mimics a natural chemical and prevents its use in cells. When taken up by cells, capecitabine gets broken down into fluorouracil, which competes with substances that are normally used to make DNA, RNA, and proteins. This stops cancer cells and other rapidly growing cells from dividing and causes them to die.</DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/capecitabine">Capecitabine</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000042852">capecitabine</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000045565">capecitabine</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Xeloda</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>ka-peh-SY-tuh-been </TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000705599" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000705600" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?labeltype=all&amp;query=CAPECITABINE&amp;pagesize=20&amp;page=1&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Capecitabine</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?labeltype=all&amp;query=CAPECITABINE&amp;pagesize=20&amp;page=1&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_1"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title><Para id="_5">Capecitabine is approved to be used alone or with other drugs to   treat:</Para><ItemizedList Style="bullet" id="_6"><ListItem><Strong><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444971" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">Breast cancer</GlossaryTermRef></Strong> that has spread.
