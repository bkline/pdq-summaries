It does this by binding to a protein called CD3 on healthy T cells and a protein called BCMA on myeloma cells. Elranatamab-bcmm is a type of  targeted therapy drug called a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE). </DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/elranatamab-bcmm">Elranatamab-bcmm </DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000792267">elranatamab-bcmm</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000813479">elranatamab</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Elrexfio</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>EL-rah-NA-tah-mab</TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000814903" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000814904" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=f6fea598-ff58-4a20-b5e8-8a51f37d8beb&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Elranatamab-bcmm</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=f6fea598-ff58-4a20-b5e8-8a51f37d8beb&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_1"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
