<DrugInformationSummary id="CDR0000698294"><DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoType>Brief</DrugInfoType><DrugInfoAudience>Patients</DrugInfoAudience><DrugInfoDescription>Ipilimumab is a type of targeted therapy drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor (a type of immunotherapy). It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the protein CTLA-4 on immune cells called T cells. It works by keeping cancer cells from suppressing the immune system. This allows the immune system to attack and kill the cancer cells.</DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ipilimumab">Ipilimumab</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000038447">ipilimumab</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000535555">ipilimumab</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Yervoy</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>ih-pih-LIH-myoo-mab</TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000718436" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000718435" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=2265ef30-253e-11df-8a39-0800200c9a66&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Ipilimumab</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=2265ef30-253e-11df-8a39-0800200c9a66&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_1"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
