<DrugInformationSummary id="CDR0000495423"><DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoType>Brief</DrugInfoType><DrugInfoAudience>Patients</DrugInfoAudience><DrugInfoDescription>Letrozole works by temporarily blocking the activity of an enzyme called aromatase, which the body uses to make estrogen in the ovaries and other tissues. Blocking aromatase decreases the amount of estrogen produced by the body and may stop the growth of cancer cells that need estrogen to grow. Letrozole is a type of hormone therapy called an aromatase inhibitor.</DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/letrozole">Letrozole</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000042086">letrozole</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000045421">letrozole</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Femara</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>LEH-truh-zole</TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000705442" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000705443" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?labeltype=all&amp;query=LETROZOLE&amp;pagesize=20&amp;page=1&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Letrozole</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?labeltype=all&amp;query=LETROZOLE&amp;pagesize=20&amp;page=1&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_1"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
