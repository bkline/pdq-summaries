<DrugInformationSummary id="CDR0000816968"><DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoType>Brief</DrugInfoType><DrugInfoAudience>Patients</DrugInfoAudience><DrugInfoDescription>Inavolisib works by blocking the activity of a protein called PI3K-alpha that signals cells to multiply. It also helps break down mutant (overactive) versions of this protein found in cancer cells.  This may keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. Inavolisib is a type of targeted therapy drug called an enzyme inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily).</DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/inavolisib">Inavolisib</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000787122">inavolisib</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000816930">inavolisib</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Itovebi</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>IH-nuh-voh-LIH-sib</TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000817447" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000817448" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=5de59f5b-e5db-410f-b692-658686ef4107&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Inavolisib</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=5de59f5b-e5db-410f-b692-658686ef4107&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_1"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
