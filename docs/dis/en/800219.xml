<DrugInformationSummary id="CDR0000800219"><DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoType>Brief</DrugInfoType><DrugInfoAudience>Patients</DrugInfoAudience><DrugInfoDescription>Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is a type of targeted therapy drug called an antibody–drug conjugate. It is a monoclonal antibody that is chemically linked to a topoisomerase I-inhibiting drug called deruxtecan. The monoclonal antibody portion binds to HER2, a protein found in high levels on some cancer cells and causes them to grow. Deruxtecan enters these cells, causing DNA damage that kills them. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki also causes a type of immune reaction that kills surrounding cells.</DrugInfoDescription><DrugInfoURL xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/famtrastuzumabderuxtecan-nxki">Fam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan-nxki</DrugInfoURL><FDAApproved>Yes</FDAApproved><TerminologyLink ref="CDR0000783025">fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki</TerminologyLink><GlossaryLink ref="CDR0000800247">fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan</GlossaryLink><USBrandNames><USBrandName>Enhertu</USBrandName></USBrandNames><PronunciationInfo><TermPronunciation>fam-tras-TOO-zoo-mab DEH-rux-TEE-kan</TermPronunciation><MediaLink ref="CDR0000801132" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000801133" type="audio/mpeg" alt="" language="es" id="_4"/></PronunciationInfo><FDAExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=7e67e73e-ddf4-4e4d-8b50-09d7514910b6&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</FDAExternalRef></DrugInfoMetaData><DrugInfoTitle>Fam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan-nxki</DrugInfoTitle><Section id="_FDA"><Para><ExternalRef xref="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=7e67e73e-ddf4-4e4d-8b50-09d7514910b6&amp;audience=consumer">FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.</ExternalRef></Para></Section><Section id="_5"><Title>Use in Cancer</Title>
