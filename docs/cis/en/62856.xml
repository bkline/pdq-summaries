  As assays have become more sensitive for detecting monoclonal B-CLL–like cells in peripheral blood, researchers have detected a monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis  in 3% of adults older than 40 years and in 6% of adults older than 60 years.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Such early detection and  diagnosis may falsely suggest improved survival for the group and may unnecessarily worry or result in therapy for some patients who would have remained undiagnosed in their lifetime, a circumstance known as overdiagnosis or pseudodisease.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_589">Confusion with other diseases may be avoided by determination of cell surface

disease entity, mantle cell lymphoma.  CLL B cells express relatively low
levels of surface-membrane immunoglobulin (compared with normal peripheral

by an absolute increase in lymphocytosis and/or bone marrow infiltration
coupled with the characteristic features of morphology and immunophenotype, which confirm the characteristic clonal population.

presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia has a similar prognosis and does not
merit a separate stage.  Neither system separates immune from nonimmune causes
