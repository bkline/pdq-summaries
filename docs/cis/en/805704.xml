Despite reimmunization, these patients can sometimes develop significant infections, and continued prophylaxis is recommended until a serological response to immunizations has been documented.

Patients should remain on infection prophylaxis (e.g., <ScientificName>Pneumocystis jirovecii</ScientificName> pneumonia  prophylaxis) until immune recovery.  Time to immune recovery varies but ranges from 3 months to 9 months after autologous HSCT, and 9 months to 24 months after allogeneic HSCT without GVHD.

These guidelines recommend that autologous transplant recipients receive immunizations beginning at 6 months after stem cell infusion and receive live vaccines 24 months after the transplant.

Traditionally, symptoms occurring more than 100 days after HSCT were considered chronic GVHD, and symptoms occurring sooner than 100 days after HSCT were considered acute GVHD.  Because some approaches to HSCT can lead to late-onset acute GVHD, and manifestations that are diagnostic for chronic GVHD can occur sooner than 100 days post-HSCT, the following three distinct types of chronic GVHD have been described: </Para><ItemizedList id="_92" Style="bullet"><ListItem><Strong>Classic chronic GVHD:</Strong> Occurs with diagnostic and/or distinct features of chronic GVHD (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000805704#_97" url="/types/childhood-cancers/hp-stem-cell-transplant/gvhd">Tables 6–10</SummaryRef>) after a previous history of resolved acute GVHD.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Overlap syndrome:</Strong> An ongoing GVHD process when manifestations diagnostic for chronic GVHD occur while symptoms of acute GVHD persist.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>De novo chronic GVHD:</Strong> New-onset GVHD generally occurring at least 2 months after transplant, with diagnostic and/or distinct features of chronic GVHD and no history or features of acute GVHD.</ListItem></ItemizedList><SummarySection id="_252"><Title>Organ Manifestations of Chronic GVHD</Title><Para id="_253">The diagnosis of chronic GVHD is based on clinical features (at least one diagnostic clinical sign, e.g., poikiloderma) or distinctive manifestations complemented by relevant tests (e.g., dry eye with positive results of a Schirmer test).<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_254">Commonly involved tissues include the skin, eyes, mouth, hair, joints, liver, and gastrointestinal tract.

Patient-reported symptoms include dry skin, itching, limited mobility, rash, sores, or changes in coloring or texture. Generalized scleroderma may lead to severe joint contractures and debility.  Associated hair loss and nail changes are common.  Other important symptoms that should be assessed include dry eyes and oral changes such as atrophy, ulcers, and lichen planus.  In addition, joint stiffness along with restricted range of motion, weight loss, nausea, difficulty swallowing, and diarrhea should be noted.</Para><Table id="_97"><Title>Table 6.
