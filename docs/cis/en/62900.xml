For glioblastoma, combined-modality therapy with resection, radiation, and chemotherapy is standard. Anaplastic astrocytomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, and anaplastic oligoastrocytomas represent only a small proportion of CNS gliomas. Therefore, phase III randomized trials restricted to these tumor types are not generally practical.   The natural histories of these tumors are variable, depending on histological and molecular factors; therefore, treatment guidelines for these tumors are evolving.
