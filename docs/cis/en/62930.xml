(i.e., buccinator, jugulodigastric, submandibular, and submental).  Sites close to
the midline often drain bilaterally.  Second station nodes include the parotid,
jugular, and the upper and lower posterior cervical nodes.
</Para><Para id="_375">Precancerous lesions of the oropharynx include leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and mixed erythroleukoplakia.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Leukoplakia, the most common of the three  conditions, is defined by the World Health Organization as “a white patch or plaque that cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically as any other disease.”<Reference refidx="2"/> The diagnosis of leukoplakia is one of exclusion; conditions such as candidiasis, lichen planus, leukoedema, and others  must be ruled out before a diagnosis of leukoplakia can be made.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_376">The prevalence of leukoplakia in the United States is decreasing as a result of reduced tobacco consumption.<Reference refidx="3"/> Although erythroplakia is not as common as leukoplakia, it is much more likely to be associated with dysplasia or carcinoma.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_366"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_6">Early cancers (stage I and stage II) of the lip and oral cavity are highly curable
by surgery or radiation therapy. The choice of treatment is dictated by
the anticipated functional and cosmetic results of treatment and by the
availability of a surgeon or radiation
oncologist with the required expertise.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>  A positive surgical margin
or a tumor depth of more than 5 mm significantly increases the risk of
local recurrence.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> The risk of occult nodal metastases increases based on depth of invasion of the primary tumor.  Depth of invasion holds prognostic significance and was included in tumor staging definitions in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging classification.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/> Extranodal extension in a lymph node is a significant adverse prognostic factor and was incorporated into the 8th edition AJCC staging system.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/> </Para><Para id="_7">Advanced cancers (stage III and stage IV) of the lip and oral cavity represent a
wide spectrum of challenges for the surgeon and radiation oncologist.  Most patients with stage III or stage IV tumors are candidates for treatment by a
combination of surgery and radiation therapy. The exception is patients with small T3 lesions and no regional lymph node and no distant
metastases or who have no lymph nodes larger than 2 cm in diameter, for whom
treatment by radiation therapy alone or surgery alone might be appropriate.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Furthermore, because local
recurrence and/or distant metastases are common in this group of patients, clinical trials can be considered.  Such trials evaluate the potential
role of radiation modifiers or combination chemotherapy combined with surgery
and/or radiation therapy.

second primary tumor of the upper aerodigestive tract.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/>  A study has shown
that daily treatment with moderate doses of isotretinoin
for 1 year can significantly reduce the incidence of
second tumors.  However, no survival advantage has been demonstrated, in
part due to recurrence and death from the primary malignancy.  
An additional trial showed no benefit of retinyl palmitate or retinyl palmitate plus beta-carotene when compared with isotretinoin alone.<Reference refidx="16"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000810025" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence B1</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_9">The cure rates of cancers of the lip and oral cavity depend
on the stage and specific site.  Most patients present with early cancers of
the lip, which are highly curable by surgery or by radiation therapy with cure
rates of 90% to 100%.  Small cancers of the retromolar trigone, hard palate,
and upper gingiva are highly curable by either radiation therapy or surgery
with survival rates of as high as 100%.  Local control rates as high as 90% can be
achieved with either radiation therapy or surgery in small cancers of the
anterior tongue, the floor of the mouth, and buccal mucosa.<Reference refidx="17"/>
</Para><Para id="_10">Moderately advanced and advanced cancers of the lip also can be controlled
effectively by surgery, radiation therapy, or both.  The
choice of treatment is generally dictated by the anticipated functional and
cosmetic results of the treatment.  Moderately advanced lesions of the
retromolar trigone without evidence of spread to cervical lymph nodes are
usually curable and have shown local control rates as high as 90%. Such lesions of the
hard palate, upper gingiva, and buccal mucosa have a local control rate of up to 80%.  In the absence of clinical evidence of spread to cervical lymph nodes,
moderately advanced lesions of the floor of the mouth and anterior tongue are
generally curable, with survival rates of as high as  70% and 65%, respectively.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/>

represent a fungal infection, lichen planus, or other benign oral disease.

estimate of the extent of disease before treatment.  The assessment of the
primary tumor is based on inspection and palpation when possible and by both
indirect mirror examination and direct endoscopy when necessary.  The tumor
must be confirmed histologically, and any other pathological data obtained on
biopsy may be included.  The appropriate nodal drainage areas are examined by
careful palpation.  Information from diagnostic imaging studies may be used in
staging.  Magnetic resonance imaging offers an advantage over computed
tomographic scans in the detection and localization of head and neck tumors and

lymph nodes. Some options for treatment of this cancer include:<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> 
</Para><ItemizedList id="_330" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Surgery
alone.</ListItem><ListItem>Radiation therapy alone.</ListItem><ListItem>A  combination of the surgery and radiation therapy.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_55">For lesions of the oral cavity, surgery must adequately encompass all of the
gross as well as the presumed microscopic extent of the disease.  If regional
nodes are positive, cervical node dissection is usually done in continuity. 
With modern approaches, the surgeon can successfully ablate large posterior
oral cavity tumors and with reconstructive methods can achieve satisfactory
functional results.  Prosthodontic rehabilitation is important, particularly in
early-stage cancers, to assure the best quality of life.
</Para><Para id="_56">Radiation therapy for lip and oral cavity cancers can be given by external-beam
radiation therapy (EBRT) or interstitial implantation alone, but for many sites the use of both
modalities produces better control and functional results.  Small superficial
cancers can be very successfully treated by local implantation using any one of
several radioactive sources, by intraoral cone radiation therapy, or by
electrons.  Larger lesions are frequently managed using EBRT to include the primary site and regional lymph nodes, even if they are
not clinically involved.  Supplementation with interstitial radiation sources
may be necessary to achieve adequate doses to large primary tumors and/or bulky
nodal metastases.  A review of published clinical results of radical radiation
therapy for head and neck cancer suggests a significant loss of local control
with prolonged radiation therapy; therefore,
lengthened standard treatment schedules should be avoided whenever
possible.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>
</Para><Para id="_57">Early cancers (stage I and stage II) of the lip, floor of the mouth, and retromolar
trigone are highly curable by surgery or radiation therapy.  The choice of
treatment is dictated by the anticipated functional and cosmetic results. Availability of a surgeon or
radiation oncologist with the required expertise for the individual patient is also a factor in treatment choice.  </Para><Para id="_333">Advanced cancers (stage III
and stage IV) of the lip, floor of the mouth, and retromolar trigone represent a wide
spectrum of challenges for the surgeon and radiation oncologists.  Most patients with stage III or stage IV tumors are candidates for treatment with a
combination of surgery and radiation therapy. The exceptions are patients with small T3 lesions and no regional lymph nodes, and no distant
metastases or patients who have no lymph nodes larger than 2 cm in diameter, for whom
treatment by radiation therapy alone or surgery alone might be appropriate.  Because local
recurrence and/or distant metastases are common in this group of patients, clinical trials that are evaluating the following should be considered:  </Para><ItemizedList id="_334" Style="bullet"><ListItem>The
potential role of radiation modifiers to improve local control or decrease
morbidity.</ListItem><ListItem>The role of combinations of chemotherapy with surgery and/or radiation
therapy to improve local control and to decrease the frequency of distant
metastases.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_58">Early cancers of the buccal mucosa are equally curable by radiation therapy or
adequate excision.  Patient factors and local expertise influence the choice
of treatment.  Larger cancers require composite resection with reconstruction
of the defect by pedicle flaps.
</Para><Para id="_59">Early lesions (T1 and T2) of the anterior tongue may be managed by surgery or
by radiation therapy alone.  Both modalities produce 70% to 85% cure rates in
patients with early lesions.  Moderate excisions of tongue, even hemiglossectomy, can often
result in little speech disability provided the wound closure is
such that the tongue is not bound down.  However, if the resection is more
extensive, problems may include aspiration of liquids and solids, difficulty
swallowing, and speech difficulties.  Occasionally, patients with
tumor of the tongue require almost total glossectomy.  Large lesions generally
require combined surgical and radiation treatment.  The control rates for
larger lesions are about 30% to 40%.  According to clinical and radiological
evidence of involvement, cancers of the lower gingiva that are exophytic and
amenable to adequate local excision may be excised to include portions of bone. 
More advanced lesions require segmental bone resection, hemimandibulectomy, or
maxillectomy, depending on the extent of the lesion and its location.
</Para><Para id="_60">Early lesions of the upper gingiva or hard palate without bone involvement can
be treated with equal effectiveness by surgery or radiation therapy alone. 
Advanced infiltrative and ulcerating lesions should be treated by a combination
of radiation therapy and surgery.  Most primary cancers of the hard palate are
of minor salivary gland origin.  Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the hard
palate is uncommon, and these tumors generally represent invasion of squamous
cell carcinoma arising on the upper gingiva, which is much more common.  Management of squamous cell carcinoma of the upper gingiva and hard palate is
usually considered together.  Surgical treatment of cancer of the hard palate
usually requires excision of underlying bone producing an opening into the
antrum.  This defect can be filled and covered with a dental prosthesis, which is a
maneuver that restores satisfactory swallowing and speech.
</Para><Para id="_61">Patients who smoke while receiving radiation therapy appear to have lower response
rates and shorter survival durations than those who do not;<Reference refidx="8"/> therefore,
patients should be counseled to stop smoking before beginning radiation
therapy.  Dental status evaluation should be performed prior to therapy to
prevent late sequelae.
