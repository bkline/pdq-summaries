women, with an estimated 69,120   new cases expected to occur in 2025 and an estimated 13,860 women  expected to die of the disease.<Reference refidx="1"/> Endometrial cancer is primarily a disease of postmenopausal women, with a mean age at diagnosis of 60 years.<Reference refidx="2"/>  
Age-adjusted endometrial cancer incidence in the United States increased from the mid-1960s to 1975 and then declined
from 1975 to 1980,  with a transient increase in incidence occurring from 1973 to 1978, which was associated with estrogen  therapy, also known as hormone therapy.<Reference refidx="3"/>  There was no associated increase in mortality. Continuing with more recent trends, incidence rates  increased by 0.6% per year in White women and by 2% to 3% per year in women of all other racial and ethnic groups. Between 2013 and 2022, death rates for endometrial cancer increased by 1.5% per year.<Reference refidx="1"/>   Most cases of endometrial cancer are diagnosed because of symptoms and typically at an <Strong>early</Strong> stage.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_53"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_54">Estrogen therapy unopposed by progesterone therapy is a cause of endometrial cancer in women with an intact uterus. However, women taking combination estrogen-progesterone  therapy (hormone therapy) exhibit similar risk to women who do not take postmenopausal hormone therapy.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>
<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Tamoxifen therapy is also a cause of  endometrial cancer.  Results from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 trial, report a doubling of the risk    of endometrial cancer associated with an annual rate  of 2.30 per 1,000 for women taking tamoxifen compared with 0.91 per 1,000 for women receiving placebo; the increased risk was seen primarily in postmenopausal women.<Reference refidx="9"/> 

</Para><Para id="_55">In addition to the increased risk of developing endometrial cancer that is observed in women who use unopposed estrogen therapy or tamoxifen, a number of additional risk factors have been identified, and most appear to be related to estrogenic effects. Among these factors are obesity, a high-fat diet, and reproductive factors such as nulliparity, polycystic ovary syndrome, early menarche, and late menopause. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome is associated with a markedly increased risk of endometrial cancer compared with women in the general population. Among women who are HNPCC carriers, the estimated cumulative incidence of endometrial cancer ranges from 20% to 60% by age 70 years (for more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Genetics of Colorectal Cancer</SummaryRef>).<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/> This risk appears to differ slightly based on the germline mutation;  for <Emphasis>MLH1</Emphasis> carriers the lifetime risk at age 70 years is 25%, while <Emphasis>MSH2</Emphasis> mutation carriers have a 35% to 40% lifetime risk of endometrial cancer by age 70 years. The mean age of diagnosis for <Emphasis>MLH1</Emphasis> or <Emphasis>MSH2</Emphasis> carriers is 47 years compared with 60 years for noninherited forms of  endometrial cancer.<Reference refidx="13"/>   The prognosis and survival are similar between HNPCC-related and noninherited forms of endometrial cancer.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_56">Major differences exist between Black and White women in stages of endometrial cancer at detection and at subsequent survival. Although the incidence of endometrial cancer is lower among Black women, mortality is higher.   The National Cancer Institute initiated a Black/White Cancer Survival Study <Reference refidx="15"/> and concluded that higher-grade and more aggressive histologies appear to be related to excess risk of advanced-stage disease in Black women.  It is difficult to disentangle the effects that biology and socioeconomic status may have on the lower survival rates of Black women with endometrial cancer.  Evidence suggests that lower income is associated with advanced-stage disease, lower probability of undergoing a hysterectomy, and lower survival rates.<Reference refidx="16"/>  Others, however, assert that there is no Black/White racial difference in the interval from patient-reported symptoms to initial medical consultation, making it unlikely that patient delay after onset of symptoms could explain much of the excess of advanced-stage disease found in Black women.<Reference refidx="17"/> Further research is necessary to understand why Black women tend to be diagnosed with more aggressive disease and have a higher probability of dying than White women, despite their lower incidence of endometrial cancer.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2025.

Among women with postmenopausal uterine bleeding and cancer, 96% will have an abnormal ET (&gt;6 mm). The specificity varies  by whether women used hormone therapy. Among nonusers, the specificity was 92%.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Much less work has been done to evaluate the accuracy of TVU among asymptomatic women. If the same ET cutoff is used among asymptomatic women, the false positives will be extremely high, resulting in a very low positive predictive value.<Reference refidx="4"/> No studies have evaluated the efficacy of screening with TVU in reducing mortality from endometrial cancer.</Para><Para id="_96">A group of researchers used dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) as a gold standard, to evaluate TVU measurement of ET as a predictor of endometrial cancer in women reporting postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) (estrogen-progestin  therapy [hormone therapy] and nonhormone therapy users).  Of the 339 participants, 39 (11.5%) were diagnosed with endometrial cancer (four had an ET of 5–7 mm and 35 had an ET &gt;8 mm) based on histopathology from curettage.  No cancers were detected in women with an ET of less than 4 mm.  Using a cutoff point of 4 mm, TVU has 100% sensitivity and 60%             specificity.<Reference refidx="7"/>  In this population, 46% (156) of the women had an ET greater than 4 mm.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_163"><Title>Ultrasonography in women without vaginal  bleeding</Title><Para id="_164">A comparison of TVU and endometrial aspiration was conducted among asymptomatic postmenopausal women potentially eligible for an osteoporosis prevention trial <Reference refidx="8"/> as part of determination of eligibility for randomization. TVU was performed on 1,926 women. Of these, 93 women had ET greater than 6 mm. Among the 93 women with abnormal ET, 42 had endometrial aspiration with one finding of abnormal pathology (defined as adenocarcinoma or atypical hyperplasia). Of the 1,833 women with ET measuring 6 mm or less, 1,750 women had endometrial aspiration and five of these women had an abnormal pathological biopsy. Among this population of asymptomatic postmenopausal women, the estimated sensitivity for TVU with a threshold value of 6 mm was 17% and 33% for a threshold value of 5 mm.</Para><Para id="_165">One study  assessed the usefulness of TVU  among a cohort of postmenopausal, asymptomatic women receiving hormone therapy. Using the Postmenopausal Estrogen and Progestin Interventions Trial participants who had undergone both TVU and endometrial biopsy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were determined for women who received placebo, estrogen alone, and estrogen-progestin therapy. At a threshold value of 5 mm for ET, TVU had 90% sensitivity and 48% specificity. Using this threshold, more than half the women would receive a biopsy while only 4% of them had serious disease.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_166">Another study obtained endometrial biopsy specimens from 801 asymptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women before enrollment in a hormone therapy study.

In addition to the protective effects for breast cancer, the biological and endocrine effects of tamoxifen increase patients’ risk of developing endometrial pathology, including endometrial polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial carcinoma.</Para><Para id="_183">There is interest in trying to reduce the morbidity from endometrial cancer through early detection, and there has been interest in using endovaginal ultrasound as a method to screen women to detect endometrial cancer. </Para><Para id="_184">In a prospective, observational study of 304 women using tamoxifen over 6 years, women underwent annual endovaginal ultrasound screening. Women with abnormal ultrasound findings and women who were symptomatic with bleeding all underwent endometrial biopsy. Thirty-two percent of the ultrasound examinations had associated significant uterine abnormalities identified that required further medical or surgical investigation and treatment. However, most abnormalities (80%) represented benign polyps for which no treatment was needed. Six cases of primary endometrial cancer were detected, and all cases presented with irregular bleeding. The sensitivity of ultrasound was only 63.3%, with a specificity of 60.4%, and had a low positive predictive value for cancer of only 1%.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_185">Other reports have noted similar results. Routine ultrasound surveillance in asymptomatic women using tamoxifen is not useful because of its low specificity and low positive predictive value.

Several methods of biopsy exist (e.g., Pipelle, Tao Brush, and Uterine Explora Curette) to identify endometrial pathology. Although endometrial sampling has largely replaced D&amp;C as the first choice in the evaluation of women with bleeding, issues of access to the endometrial cavity and sampling error    limit the clinical significance of a negative result.  In the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination  trial, 36% of biopsies had insufficient tissue for diagnosis. A meta-analysis of PMB reported that 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87%–93%) of women with endometrial cancer reported PMB.

The evidence is solid that endometrial  sampling may result in discomfort, bleeding, infection, and rarely uterine perforation.
