Knowledge of cell surface markers and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements may help with diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The clonal excess of light-chain immunoglobulin may differentiate malignant cells from reactive cells. Because the prognosis and the approach to treatment are influenced by histopathology, outside biopsy specimens should be carefully reviewed by a hematopathologist who is experienced in diagnosing lymphomas. Although lymph node biopsies are recommended whenever possible, sometimes immunophenotypic data are sufficient for diagnosis of lymphoma when fine-needle aspiration cytology or core needle biopsy is preferred.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1625"><Title>Historical Classification Systems</Title><Para id="_1627">Historically, uniform treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has been hampered by the lack of a uniform classification system.

different manifestations of the same neoplasm, as are lymphoblastic lymphomas

Many of the improvements in survival have been made because of clinical trials that have attempted to improve on conventional or standard therapy.</Para><Para id="_1572">In asymptomatic patients with indolent forms of advanced NHL, treatment may be
deferred until the patient becomes symptomatic as the disease progresses.  When
treatment is deferred, the clinical course of patients with indolent NHL
varies; frequent and careful observation is required so that effective
treatment can be initiated when the clinical course of the disease accelerates. 
Some patients have a prolonged indolent course, but others have disease that
rapidly evolves into more aggressive types of NHL that require immediate
treatment.</Para><Para id="_1573">Radiation techniques differ somewhat from those used in the treatment of
Hodgkin lymphoma.  The dose of radiation therapy usually varies from 25 Gy to
50 Gy and is dependent on factors that include the histological type of
lymphoma, the patient’s stage and overall condition, the goal of treatment
(curative or palliative), the proximity of sensitive surrounding organs, and
whether the patient is being treated with radiation therapy alone or in
combination with chemotherapy.  Given the patterns of
disease presentations and relapse, treatment may need to include unusual sites
such as Waldeyer ring, epitrochlear nodes, or mesenteric nodes.   The
associated morbidity of the treatment  must be considered carefully.  Most patients who receive radiation are treated on only one side
of the diaphragm.  Localized presentations of extranodal NHL may be treated
with involved-field techniques with significant (&gt;50%) success.</Para><Para id="_2008">In situations where mediastinal radiation therapy would encompass the left side of the heart or would increase breast cancer risk in young female patients, proton therapy may be considered to reduce radiation dose to organs at risk.<Reference refidx="1"/> For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000352186#_97" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/cardiopulmonary-hp-pdq">Superior Vena Cava Syndrome</SummaryRef> section in Cardiopulmonary Syndromes.</Para><Table id="_1574">

Favorable survival after relapse has been associated with an age younger than 60 years, complete remission rather than partial remission, and duration of response longer than 2 years.<Reference refidx="1"/> Even patients in the most favorable subset, however, have a tenfold greater mortality compared with age-adjusted U.S. population rates.<Reference refidx="2"/> </Para><Para id="_1727">Patients who experience a relapse of indolent lymphoma can often achieve disease control with single-agent or combination chemotherapy, rituximab (an anti–CD20 monoclonal antibody), lenalidomide, radiolabeled anti–CD20 monoclonal antibodies, or palliative radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> However, long-term freedom from second relapse is uncommon and multiple relapses usually occur. Patients with indolent lymphoma may experience a relapse with a more aggressive histology. If the clinical pattern of relapse suggests that the disease is behaving in a more aggressive manner, a biopsy can be performed. If a more aggressive histology is confirmed, therapy must change to a regimen applicable to that histological type.<Reference refidx="5"/> Rapid growth or discordant growth between various disease sites may indicate a histological conversion.</Para><Para id="_1728">In a retrospective review of 325 patients diagnosed between 1972 and 1999, the 10-year risk of histological transformation was 30%.<Reference refidx="6"/>  In this series, high-risk factors for subsequent histological transformation were advanced stage, high-risk Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index, and watchful waiting (as opposed to treatment being initiated at diagnosis).
