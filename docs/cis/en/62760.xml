Epithelial cancers are the most common type of ovarian cancer and are further classified into five main types: high-grade serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, and low-grade serous carcinomas.<Reference refidx="1"/> Data from detailed pathology reviews of specimens removed during risk-reducing surgery from carriers of <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations have demonstrated a putative precursor of high-grade serous carcinoma in the fimbria of the fallopian tube (serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma [STIC]), suggesting that many carcinomas in this group previously classified as ovarian are actually tubal primary tumors. Similar lesions have been found in noncarriers of <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutations, but most data from this group are limited by the presence of concurrent bulky carcinomas throughout the pelvis. STIC is not found in all cases of high-grade serous carcinoma, suggesting other possible origins of these tumors.

Women were randomly assigned to screening (n = 39,105) or usual care (n = 39,111) at ten screening centers across the United States between November 1993 and July 2001. Participants and their health care practitioners
received the screening test results and managed evaluation of abnormal results.
The usual-care group was not offered screening with CA-125 or TVU but received their usual medical care. Participants were initially monitored  for a maximum of 13 years (median, 12.4 years; range, 10.9–13.0 years)
for cancer diagnoses and death until February 28, 2010. Mortality from ovarian cancer, including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers, was the main outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included ovarian cancer incidence
and complications associated with screening examinations and diagnostic procedures.<Reference refidx="20"/> After transition of PLCO trial participants to a centralized follow-up process, follow-up for mortality was extended until the end of 2012, for a maximum of 19.2 years and a median of 14.7 years.<Reference refidx="21"/></Para><Para id="_128">Compliance with screening ranged from 85% at the initial round to 73% at the sixth round, while contamination in the usual-care group ranged from about 3.0% for CA-125  to 4.6% for TVU.  Across the first four screening rounds, 11.1% of women had at least one positive test, 8.1% had at least one positive TVU, and 3.4% had at least one positive CA-125 test.  The yields of both tests were similar. Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 212 women (5.7 per 10,000 person-years) in the intervention group and 176 women (4.7 per 10,000 person-years) in the usual-care group (rate ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.99–1.48). The stage distributions were similar by study group, with stage III and IV cancers comprising most cases in both the intervention group (163 cases, 77%) and the usual-care group (137 cases, 78%).  The cancer case treatment distributions were very similar between groups within each stage. Through the original  period of follow-up (maximum, 13 years), ovarian cancer caused 118 deaths (3.1 per 10,000 person-years) in the intervention group and
100 deaths (2.6 per 10,000 person-years) in the usual-care group (mortality rate ratio, 1.18;

The UKCTOCS multimodal screen incorporated a two-stage approach with ROCA as the primary screen and TVS as a secondary screen (based on results of the ROCA) for its impact on ovarian cancer mortality compared with observation without screening. Of 50,078 women in the multimodality screening arm, 452 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 296 died of the disease.

Best-case scenario assumed that all cancers that would have been detected earlier with ROCA than with single-threshold CA-125 concentrations would have avoided mortality.  The stage-shift scenario applied the observed PLCO early-stage survival rates to cases detected at an earlier stage with ROCA.  The risk of death from ovarian cancer with ROCA was lower, but estimates were not statistically significant  (relative risk [RR] of 0.90 for best-case scenario [95% CI, 0.69–1.17] and RR of 0.95 for stage-shift scenario [95% CI, 0.74–1.23]).</Para><Para id="_144">Another retrospective study using annual CA-125 concentrations from the PLCO trial examined the potential impact of parametric empirical Bayes  (PEB) longitudinal algorithm for the earlier detection of 44 incident ovarian cancers identified in the PLCO trial.  Setting the specificity at 99%,  PEB signaled “abnormal” CA-125 concentrations, on average, 10 months earlier than with the single-threshold cutpoint.<Reference refidx="27"/>  An analysis of serial CA-125 concentrations from the UKCTOCS trial demonstrated superior performance characteristics for ovarian cancer screening using longitudinal algorithms, compared with a single CA-125 threshold.<Reference refidx="28"/> Whether  either of these approaches translates into a mortality benefit could not be determined.</Para><Para id="_145">CA-125 velocity has also been examined using a multiple logistic regression model within the PLCO trial as a predictor for the development of ovarian cancer.<Reference refidx="29"/>  Both CA-125 velocity and time intervals between screening tests were associated with the development of ovarian cancer.  The risk of ovarian cancer increased as velocity (measured as U/mL per month) increased, and the risk of ovarian cancer decreased when the time intervals between screening tests increased.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="15187051">Goff BA, Mandel LS, Melancon CH, et al.: Frequency of symptoms of ovarian cancer in women presenting to primary care clinics.
