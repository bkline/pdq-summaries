Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.  </Caption></MediaLink><Para id="_869">Chemotherapy drugs used alone or in combination to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma in children include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_870" Style="bullet"><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000717920" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/asparaginase-erwinia-chrysanthemi">asparaginase</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000557107" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/carboplatin">carboplatin</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000557430" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/cyclophosphamide">cyclophosphamide</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000540242" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/cytarabine">cytarabine</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000769031" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/dexamethasone">dexamethasone</DrugRef> (steroid)</ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000542867" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/doxorubicinhydrochloride">doxorubicin</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000589795" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/etoposide">etoposide</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000762190" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/idarubicinhydrochloride">idarubicin</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000686471" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ifosfamide">ifosfamide</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000586940" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/methotrexate-sodium">methotrexate</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000652391" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/prednisone">prednisone</DrugRef> (steroid)</ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000688288" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/vinblastinesulfate">vinblastine</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000599877" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/vincristinesulfate">vincristine</DrugRef></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_871">Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.</Para><Para id="_450">The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">stage</GlossaryTermRef> of the cancer being treated.</Para><Para id="_872">Learn more about <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/chemotherapy">Chemotherapy to Treat Cancer</ExternalRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_62"><KeyPoint id="_63">Radiation therapy</KeyPoint><Para id="_113"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">Radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
