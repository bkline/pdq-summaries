For acupuncture to become part of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000346525" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">standard of care</GlossaryTermRef> for cancer patients, further education about acupuncture, improved insurance coverage, and accessibility to qualified acupuncturists are needed.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_11">More than 40 states and the District of Columbia have laws regulating acupuncture practice.   The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine offers national certification examinations for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463164" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">practitioners</GlossaryTermRef> of acupuncture and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449722" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">traditional Chinese medicine</GlossaryTermRef> (TCM) (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.nccaom.org/">www.nccaom.org</ExternalRef>); most, but not all, states require this certification. More than 50 schools and colleges of acupuncture and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449739" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">Oriental medicine</GlossaryTermRef> operate in the United States, many of which offer master’s-level programs and are accredited by or have been granted candidacy status by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM). ACAOM standards for a master's-level degree require a 3-year program (approximately 2,000 hours of study) for acupuncture and a 4-year program for Oriental medicine, which includes acupuncture and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462683" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">herbal therapy</GlossaryTermRef> (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.acaom.org/">www.ACAOM.org</ExternalRef>).  In recent years, some schools have begun to offer programs for Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine with an additional 1,200 hours of clinical-based doctoral training. Some Western medical training, including the study of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467828" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">anatomy</GlossaryTermRef>, physiology, and clean-needle technique, is included in the curriculums of these schools. Postgraduate training programs in medical acupuncture for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390246" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">physicians</GlossaryTermRef> also exist. In the United States, training to be a licensed <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000613192" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">acupuncturist</GlossaryTermRef>  is regulated according to individual state law. Because the educational and licensing requirements for acupuncture practice vary from state to state, one should inquire from each state board of acupuncture (or other relevant board) for information (<ExternalRef xref="https://www.nccaom.org/">www.nccaom.org</ExternalRef>). Third-party reimbursements also vary from state to state.   Some insurance companies cover acupuncture or limited acupuncture treatment.  Federal payers such as  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000640052" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">Medicare</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000640050" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">Medicaid</GlossaryTermRef>  do not generally reimburse for acupuncture treatment. </Para><Para id="_12">Acupuncture has been practiced in China and other Asian countries for more than 4,000 years.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/> In China, acupuncture is part of a TCM system of traditional medical knowledge and is practiced along with other treatment <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270868" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">modalities</GlossaryTermRef> such as herbal medicine, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454783" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">tui na</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454761" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">massage</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046723" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">acupressure</GlossaryTermRef>), <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467850" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">mind/body exercise</GlossaryTermRef> (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467860" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">qigong</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467869" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">tai chi</GlossaryTermRef>), and dietary therapy.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/> In the United States, several different acupuncture styles are practiced in addition to TCM. These include Japanese acupuncture (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449744" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">meridian</GlossaryTermRef> therapy), English acupuncture (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467839" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">five-element or traditional acupuncture</GlossaryTermRef>), French acupuncture (e.g., French energetic acupuncture), <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000485163" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">Korean acupuncture</GlossaryTermRef> (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467834" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">constitutional acupuncture</GlossaryTermRef>), and American medical acupuncture. Most of these styles are derived from ancient Chinese medical philosophy and practices. All are based on the view that the human body must be perceived and treated as a whole and as part of nature; health is the result of harmony among bodily functions and between the body and nature, and disease occurs when this harmony is disrupted. TCM <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043985" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">therapeutic</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454757" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">interventions</GlossaryTermRef>, including acupuncture, are used to restore the state of harmony.</Para><Para id="_13">Acupuncture is closely associated with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449742" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">Chinese meridian theory</GlossaryTermRef>.  According to this theory, there are 12 primary meridians, or channels, and eight additional meridians, each following a particular directional course along the body.

Chinese medicine proposes that the purpose of acupuncture therapy is to normalize energy flow, thereby relieving the symptoms by stimulating specific sites (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449727" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">acupuncture points</GlossaryTermRef>) on the meridians.<Reference refidx="22"/>  In acupuncture treatment, stainless steel needles, usually ranging from 0.22 mm to 0.25 mm in

The reduction in hot flashes in all patients persisted during the 6 months of follow-up (RA arm, 6.1 per day; SA arm, 6.8 per day).

The investigators observed a significant reduction in hot flash frequency and severity in both groups. In addition, 2 weeks after treatments were stopped, patients randomly assigned to venlafaxine reported increased hot-flash frequency, whereas the acupuncture group remained at a low level of hot flashes. There was no significant difference between the acupuncture arm and the venlafaxine arm. There were 18 reported adverse events (i.e., nausea, dizziness, headache) in the venlafaxine arm and none in the acupuncture arm.

There was also a statistically positive effect on sleep when RA was compared with SA.  Importantly, the researchers measured the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045839" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">plasma</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000305990" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">estradiol</GlossaryTermRef> level and determined that there was not a correlation between symptoms improvement and an increase in estradiol level.<Reference refidx="70"/></Para><Para id="_240">In 2014, a study reported the results of a two-arm RCT (N = 47) on the effect of acupuncture in reducing AIMSS and hot flashes as one of the secondary end points. When compared with baseline, acupuncture significantly improved hot-flash severity, frequency, and function. SA significantly improved the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale only.  However, there was no significant difference between the two groups.<Reference refidx="71"/></Para><Para id="_241">These trials once again confirmed that acupuncture is safe.  They showed that acupuncture reduced hot flashes significantly when compared with baseline, although the benefit of RA versus SA was not clear.</Para><Para id="_271">A 2015 systematic review of acupuncture to control hot flashes in cancer patients showed that in all eight studies included in the review, acupuncture resulted in significant improvement from the baseline, and three studies showed RA was significantly better than SA in different aspects of hot flashes. However, none of the studies were rated with a low risk of bias.<Reference refidx="72"/>  A 2016 meta-analysis of 12 RCTs published before April 2015 on the efficacy of acupuncture or EA on breast cancer survivors suffering from hot flashes failed to show a favorable effect of acupuncture on reducing the frequency of hot flashes when compared with control groups such as SA, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045110" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">hormone therapy</GlossaryTermRef>, antidepressants, or relaxation intervention.<Reference refidx="73"/> The authors explained that this finding may be due to heterogeneity of the studies, small sample size of the studies, and the underlying methodological issues with some studies.  Another 2016 systematic review of 12 RCTs (including eight in the aforementioned meta-analysis) found that all RCTs showed the effect of acupuncture when compared with  no acupuncture.  However, only two of  the six RCTs comparing RA with SA showed significant benefit of acupuncture over placebo.  The other studies showed that acupuncture was no better than hormone therapy, venlafaxine, or relaxation controls.<Reference refidx="74"/>  Consequently, there is insufficient evidence supporting or refuting using acupuncture to treat hot flashes.  Further studies are needed.</Para><Para id="_272">A study published in 2015 that used EA in the treatment of hot flashes  randomly assigned 120 breast cancer survivors who were suffering from hot flashes at least twice daily to one of four of the following arms: EA, SA, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045039" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">gabapentin</GlossaryTermRef> (GP), and placebo pills (PP) for 8 weeks.<Reference refidx="75"/>  Unlike other acupuncture efficacy trials, however, the primary end point was the change in hot flash composite scores (HFCS) between SA and PP at week 8, with secondary end points including posttreatment comparisons of all groups at different time points and examination of treatment durability at week 24.  It showed that SA produced significantly greater reductions in HFCS than did PP by week 8, indicating a greater placebo effect with SA. Although all arms experienced HFCS reductions, SA produced significantly better results than did both GP and PP interventions (EA,  −7.4; SA,  −5.9; GP,  −5.2; and PP, −3.4), compared with baseline scores. In addition, SA had a smaller <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000792402" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">nocebo effect</GlossaryTermRef> than PP, as evidenced by the significantly higher percentage of reported adverse events for PP (20.0%) compared with SA (3.1%).   Another intriguing finding is the more-durable effect in HFCS reductions produced at week 24 (16 weeks posttreatment) with both EA and SA treatments (EA,   −8.5; SA,   −6.1) than with GP (GP, −2.8), suggesting that both types of acupuncture may elicit underlying <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045837" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">physiologic</GlossaryTermRef> changes not induced by pharmacologic intervention. On the other hand, the effect size of EA compared with SA was small at week 8 (Cohen’s d, 0.21) but got bigger at week 24 (Cohen’s d, 0.31), suggesting EA may produce additional or longer-lasting physiological effects than would SA.<Reference refidx="75"/></Para><Para id="_275">A 2016 pragmatic RCT (N = 190) that compared individualized acupuncture plus enhanced self-care (as described in an information booklet provided to all patients) with enhanced self-care alone showed that the combination therapy is superior to self-care alone in reducing hot flash scores at the end of treatment, at the 3-month follow-up visit, and at the 6-month follow-up visit.<Reference refidx="76"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335127" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: 1iiC</LOERef>]   In addition, this highly impactful  study also showed that acupuncture significantly improved patients’ QOL without any serious <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044922" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">adverse effects</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="76"/> It used the standard <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449722" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">traditional Chinese medicine</GlossaryTermRef> acupuncture approach, which first identified <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046296" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">menopausal</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045090" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">syndromes</GlossaryTermRef> according to Maciocia’s recommendations and consequently chose individualized acupoints in addition to three common acupoints: SP6, LI11, and CV4.<Reference refidx="76"/>  This study  provides solid evidence to support the use of acupuncture to reduce hot flashes and improve breast cancer survivors’ QOL.
