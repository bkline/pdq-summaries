The content in PDQ Cancer Genetics summaries covers  evidence on inherited genetic risk factors, including the cancer risks and management associated with hereditary cancer syndromes (including pathogenic variants in specific genes that cause them). Knowledge of genetic components that contribute to  cancer risk  rapidly improves our understanding of cancer biology and helps identify individuals  with increased cancer risk. These findings enhance the ability to characterize malignancies, establish treatment tailored to the molecular fingerprint of specific cancers, and lead to the development of new therapeutic modalities.  As a consequence, this expanding knowledge base has implications for all aspects of cancer management, including prevention, screening, and treatment.</Para><Para id="_3">Family histories of cancer can help identify individuals who are at increased risk of developing cancer and select candidates for hereditary cancer genetic testing. Genetic testing results  can indicate that individuals have increased cancer risk  or that a cancer has an underlying genetic predisposition.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2744"><Title>Cancer Genetics Concepts and Terminology</Title><Para id="_2747">The term, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000776887" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">variant</GlossaryTermRef>,  describes a difference (i.e., genetic change) between an individual  or a group of individuals who are being studied and the DNA reference sequence. The term, mutation, is sometimes still used in patient settings. Variants are classified as benign (harmless), likely benign, of uncertain significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic (affects gene function and is disease-associated).

A well-recognized bottleneck to utilizing NGS data is the lack of advanced computational infrastructure to preserve, process, and analyze the vast amount of genetic data.

With targeted multigene testing, a number of different genes can be assessed simultaneously. These targeted multigene tests can differ substantially in the genes that are included, and they can be tailored to individual tumor types. Targeted multigene testing limits the data to be analyzed and includes only known genes, which makes the interpretation more straightforward than in whole exome or whole genome techniques. In addition, greater <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000778722" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">depth of coverage</GlossaryTermRef> is possible with targeted multigene testing than with WES or WGS. Depth of coverage refers to the number of times a nucleotide has been sequenced; a greater depth of coverage has fewer sequencing errors.  Deep coverage also aids in differentiating sequencing errors from <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000458046" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">single nucleotide polymorphisms</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_2618">WES and WGS are far more extensive techniques and aim to uncover variants in known genes and in genes not suspected a priori.   The discovery of a variant that is unexpected for a particular  tumor type can lead to the use of a directed therapeutic, which could improve patient outcome. WES generates sequence data of the coding regions of the genome (representing approximately 1% of the human genome), rather than the entire genome (WGS).  Consequently, WES is less expensive than WGS. </Para><Para id="_2619">Noncoding variants can be identified using WGS but cannot be identified using WES. The use of WGS is limited by cost and the vast bioinformatics needed for interpretation. Although the costs of sequencing have dropped precipitously, the analysis remains formidable.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_2620">Although the goal of WES and WGS is to improve patient care by detecting actionable genetic variants (variants that can be targeted therapeutically), a number of issues warrant consideration.  This testing may detect pathogenic variants, variants of uncertain significance (VUS), or no detectable abnormalities. In addition, pathogenic variants can be found in genes that are thought to be clearly related to tumorigenesis but can also be detected in genes with unclear relevance (particularly with WES and WGS approaches). VUS have unclear implications as they may, or may not, disrupt the function of the protein. The definition of actionable can vary, but often this term is used when an aberration, if found, would lead to recommendations against certain treatments (such as variants in <GeneName>ras</GeneName>) for which a clinical trial is available, or for which there is a known targeted drug.

A study that estimated the prevalence of germline variants from patients undergoing tumor sequencing with matched, normal DNA sequencing reported that cancer susceptibility genes were identified in 198 of 1,566 individuals (12.6%). Only 81 of these 198 individuals (40.9%) had pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes concordant with their tumor type.

In addition, there are emerging data that germline status may help determine systemic therapy (e.g., the use of cisplatin or poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase [PARP] inhibitors in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>-related cancer). </Para><Para id="_2624">Most germline genetic testing has been performed in a targeted manner, looking for variants in the gene(s) associated with a clinical picture (e.g., <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer or the mismatch repair [MMR] genes in Lynch syndrome). However, targeted multigene tests available commercially or within an institution contain different sets of genes. Some target all cancers, while others target specific cancers (e.g.,  breast, colon, or prostate cancers). The genes on the multigene tests include high-penetrance genes related to the specific tumor (such as  <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> on a breast cancer panel); high penetrance genes related to a different type of cancer but with a more moderate risk for the tumor of reference (such as <GeneName>CDH1</GeneName> or <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName> on a breast cancer panel); and moderate penetrance genes for which clinical utility is uncertain (such as <GeneName>NBN </GeneName>on a breast cancer panel). Because multiple genes are included on these panels, it is anticipated that many, and perhaps most, individuals undergoing testing using these panels will be found to have at least one VUS. As it is not possible to do standard pretest counseling models for a panel of 20 genes, new counseling models are needed. Ethical issues of whether patients can opt out of specific results (such as <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> or <GeneName>CDH1</GeneName> in breast cancer) and how this would be done in clinical practice are unresolved. </Para><Para id="_2691">Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865#_1320" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/risk-assessment-hp-pdq">Multigene (panel) testing</SummaryRef> section in the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/risk-assessment-hp-pdq">Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling</SummaryRef> for more information about the use of targeted multigene tests.</Para><Para id="_2625">WES for inherited cancer susceptibility is also commercially available.

For example, the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumors has developed such a process for the MMR genes in concert with the Human Variome Project and International Mismatch Repair Consortium.  </Para><Para id="_2606">These processes may serve as a framework for the emerging challenge of interpreting the significance of sequence variations in genes of uncertain or unknown function in regulation of neoplastic progression or other diseases.  Larger cancer predisposition multigene tests have been developed by commercial laboratories, with their own process for interpretation.  To the extent that increasingly larger multigene tests include genes of unknown significance, governance of the interpretation process requires that academic institutions offering their own multigene tests or using external proprietary panels develop a deliberative process for managing the quality assurance for test performance (including Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA], where appropriate) and interpretation.</Para><Para id="_2607">ACMG has issued the following updated guidelines for achieving accountability in interpreting and reporting secondary findings:<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="18"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_2608" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Constitutional variants in a list of 56 genes should be reported by the laboratory to the ordering clinician, regardless of the indication for which the clinical sequencing was ordered and regardless of patient age. This includes the normal sample of a tumor-normal sequenced dyad. Patients may opt out of such analysis after clear understanding of the ramifications and full informed consent prior to clinical sequencing.</ListItem><ListItem>Only variants previously reported and a recognized cause of the disorder, or variants previously unreported but of the type expected to cause the disorder, should be reported.</ListItem><ListItem>When clinical genome-scale sequencing is performed, written informed consent should be obtained by a qualified genetics health-care professional describing the nature of the test and addressing issues such as interpretive uncertainty, privacy, familial impact, and generation of secondary findings.</ListItem><ListItem>Clinicians should be familiar with basic attributes and limitations of clinical sequencing.</ListItem><ListItem>ACMG, together with content experts and other professional organizations, should continue to refine and update such guidelines annually.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_2641">Concerns remain that the routine reporting of germline variants in the context of tumor sequencing would require laboratories to conduct results review with germline and tumor genome expertise, which would be expected to increase costs, laboratory efforts, and turnaround time for results reporting.  The nature of discussions between oncologists and patients would be altered to include the multiple facets involved with germline testing and potential results.  Pre- and post-test discussions would also potentially require involvement of genetic counselors and geneticists, who are a limited resource in oncology practices. Recent expert comment stated that more data are needed about the benefits of return of secondary germline findings to cancer patients undergoing tumor sequencing, citing a need for recommendations by experts in the oncology and genetics communities.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_2609">It is still very early in the development processes for oversight at the institutional level.  As an example, at one high-volume cancer center, the following process has been used:</Para><OrderedList id="_2610" Style="Arabic">
     <ListItem>When considering evaluation of tumor tissue for research purposes, patients are asked to consent to undergo tests of very large panels of somatic tissue that are paired with corresponding panels for constitutional tissue.  The key research undertakings involve evaluating for differences in prognosis and treatment response according to variant patterns in tumors.</ListItem><ListItem>The consent process outlines the possibility that variants suggesting underlying tumor susceptibility may be identified.  Patients are asked whether they want to receive this information, should an actionable genetic variant be identified. Patients also receive  expedited genetic counseling (via counselors associated with the research protocol).  If a patient has chosen not to receive such actionable genetic variant information, findings will nevertheless be reported to the patient’s institutional primary care physician (PCP).  Unresolved to date are the circumstances in which a patient may be approached again by his or her PCP regarding pertinent findings, notwithstanding a previous decline to receive such information.</ListItem><ListItem>When potentially significant results are found, the specific test may be repeated in a CLIA lab.</ListItem><ListItem>A committee was formed to review variants to determine whether they are considered pathogenic or otherwise actionable.</ListItem><ListItem>A second committee was formed to provide oversight for the conduct of such protocols, in the interest of deliberately evolving the processes above in a manner consistent with the anticipated routine performance of such panels in cancer patients, balanced against the need for patient autonomy and appropriately detailed informed consent.</ListItem></OrderedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2611"><Title>Informed Consent Issues Arising From the Application of NGS</Title><Para id="_2612">Informed consent for the sequencing of highly penetrant disease genes has been conducted since the mid-1990s in the contexts of known or suspected inherited diseases within selected families. However, the best methods and  approaches for educating and counseling individuals about the potential benefits, limitations, and harms of genetic testing to facilitate informed decisions have not been fully elucidated or adequately tested. New informed consent challenges arise as NGS technologies are applied in clinical and research settings. Challenges to facilitating informed consent include the following:

</Para><ItemizedList id="_2613" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Providing a person-centered appreciation for the breadth and diversity of medical risks potentially identified through genomic sequencing. Establishing informed consent may be particularly challenging in medically underserved populations with less familiarity with the concept of disease risk and in individuals with no previous knowledge, experience, or context of the disease(s) for which they are identified to be at increased risk.</ListItem><ListItem>Sequencing for diseases without clear management algorithms or identified best practices.</ListItem><ListItem>Interpretation of variants of possible but unclear pathogenicity.</ListItem><ListItem>Communicating genetic information that may be of relevance for other family members.</ListItem><ListItem>Additional challenges are anticipated as health care providers not trained in genetic/genomic medicine order and receive results on behalf of their patients with the expectation to return and manage medically actionable results. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_2665">The increased availability and decreased cost of NGS technology are expanding the use of genome-wide testing of tumors, with the goal of identifying somatic variants as potential targets for cancer treatment.  While identifying germline pathogenic variants may be considered secondary to the main purpose of testing tumors, the possibility of identifying actionable secondary findings of pathogenic variants in cancer predisposition genes supports the need for genetic counseling in this context.  Approaches for genetic counseling and informed consent in the context of tumor sequencing have been proposed.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2614"><Title>Conclusion</Title><Para id="_2632">Advances in genetic sequencing technologies have dramatically reduced the cost of sequencing an individual's full genome or exome. WGS and WES are increasingly being employed in the clinical setting in testing for both somatic variants and germline variants. In addition, multigene tests are now available commercially or within an institution. Considerable debate surrounds the clinical, ethical, legal, and counseling aspects associated with NGS and gene panels. Future research is warranted to address these issues.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="22304912">Dancey JE, Bedard PL, Onetto N, et al.: The genetic basis for cancer treatment decisions.
