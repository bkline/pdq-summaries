</Question><Answer><Para id="_35">The vegetable and herb mixture now called Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup was developed to treat cancer.</Para><ItemizedList id="_20" Style="bullet"><ListItem>In the mid-1980's, the developer created the mixture to treat a relative who was <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">diagnosed</GlossaryTermRef> with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045144" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">stage IV non-small cell lung cancer</GlossaryTermRef> and not helped by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044930" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">standard treatment</GlossaryTermRef>.  The mixture contained shiitake mushroom, mung bean, and the herbs <ScientificName>Hedyotis diffusa</ScientificName> and barbat skullcap. The developer believed  these ingredients contain substances that may block the growth of  cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cells</GlossaryTermRef>  and/or help the body's <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> attack cancer cells. The relative was reported to be alive and free of cancer more than 13 years later. Three more patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478743" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">advanced cancer</GlossaryTermRef>  were treated with a combination of shiitake mushroom and mung bean. These patients were also reported to benefit from the treatment.</ListItem><ListItem>In 1992, the developer applied for a patent for Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup as an herbal treatment of cancer. The developer reported on <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454774" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">animal studies</GlossaryTermRef> done in mice (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000466209#_8" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/suns-soup-pdq">Question 5</SummaryRef>). The developer then  began doing <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000466209#_9" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/suns-soup-pdq">Question 6</SummaryRef>) to test Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup in cancer patients. </ListItem><ListItem>In 1995, the developer was awarded a patent for Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_36">Many of the vegetables and herbs in Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup were chosen because previous research and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449722" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">traditional Chinese medicine</GlossaryTermRef> suggest they contain anticancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044709" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">phytochemicals</GlossaryTermRef> (substances found in plants that may have effects on the body).

One of these ingredients  is shiitake mushroom. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044157" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">Lentinan</GlossaryTermRef>, which is taken from shiitake mushroom, has been used in Japan to treat  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445087" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">stomach</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044237" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">colon cancer</GlossaryTermRef> after <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045570" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">surgery</GlossaryTermRef>. Treatment with lentinan is reported to help patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445087" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">stomach cancer</GlossaryTermRef> live longer and have a better <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef>. Lentinan may not be easily absorbed by the body from food, so it is usually given by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044678" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">injection</GlossaryTermRef>. Other substances in shiitake mushroom that are more easily used by the body from food have shown anticancer activity in animal tests.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_7"><Question>How is Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup administered?</Question><Answer><Para id="_25">Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup is eaten as part of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">diet</GlossaryTermRef>.

	Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup?</Question><Answer><Para id="_26">Few <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044517" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">preclinical studies</GlossaryTermRef> have been done with Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup. Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">drug</GlossaryTermRef>, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. Preclinical studies are done before clinical trials (in humans) are begun.  </Para><Para id="_27">A small number of mice were injected with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> cells and fed either standard food or food mixed with one or more ingredients from Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup.  The researchers reported that the growth of tumors was slower in the mice that were fed the Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup ingredients, compared to the mice that ate standard food. The tumor growth was slowest when the mice were fed both mung bean and shiitake mushroom.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_9"><Question>Have any  clinical trials (research studies with people) of Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup been conducted?</Question><Answer><Para id="_28">Clinical trials using Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup to treat cancer have been done with small numbers of patients. These patients received other types of treatment, either before or during treatment with Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup, and different vegetable mixtures were used in the different studies.</Para><Para id="_29">The results of these trials were compared with published information on similar patients who did not receive Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup. Most patients receiving the vegetable mixtures lived longer, were better able to carry out their daily activities, and either gained weight or did not lose weight.  In some patients who ate Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup, tumor growth slowed or the tumor completely went away. Because patients in these trials received other treatments, it is not known if their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">responses</GlossaryTermRef> were caused by Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup, the other treatments, or both.  None of the trials were <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045858" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">randomized</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044014" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">controlled</GlossaryTermRef>. Randomized clinical trials give the highest level of evidence. In randomized trials, volunteers are put randomly (by chance) into one of 2 or more groups that compare different treatments. In  a controlled  trial, one group (called the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">control group</GlossaryTermRef>) does not receive the new treatment being studied. The control group is then compared to the groups that receive the new treatment, to see if the new treatment works. Randomized controlled trials, enrolling larger numbers of people, are needed to confirm the results of studies done so far on Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup. </Para><Para id="_34">One randomized clinical trial (<ProtocolRef nct_id="NCT00246727">NCT00246727</ProtocolRef>) of patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045367" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">stage IIIB</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045144" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">stage IV non-small cell lung cancer</GlossaryTermRef> was conducted. The trial compared the survival of patients receiving Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup with patients receiving a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046688" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">placebo</GlossaryTermRef> (inactive substance).

During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutIACT_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutIACT_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutIACT_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutIACT_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutIACT_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Therapies</Title><Para id="_AboutIACT_7">It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutIACT_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm.</Para><Para id="_AboutIACT_9"><ExternalRef xref="https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM.
