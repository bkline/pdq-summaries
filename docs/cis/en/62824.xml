Lung cancer is more common in men than women and in those of lower socioeconomic status.  Patterns of lung cancer according to demographic characteristics tend to be strongly correlated with historical patterns of cigarette smoking prevalence.  An exception is the very high rate of lung cancer in African American men, a group whose very high lung cancer death rate is not explainable simply by historical smoking patterns.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_168">In nonsmokers, important lung cancer risk factors are exposure to secondhand smoke, exposure to ionizing radiation, and occupational exposure to lung carcinogens, such as asbestos. Radiation exposures relevant to the general population include environmental exposure to radon and radiation exposures administered in the medical care setting, particularly when administered at high doses, such as radiation therapy to the chest or breast.<Reference refidx="2"/> Cigarette smoking often interacts with these other factors.  There are several examples, including radon exposure and asbestos exposure, in which the combined exposure to cigarette smoke plus another risk factor results in an increase in risk that is much greater than the sum of the risks associated with each factor alone.</Para><SummarySection id="_172"><Title>Factors associated with increased risk of lung cancer</Title><SummarySection id="_173"><Title>Cigarette smoking</Title><Para id="_174">Starting with the 1964 Surgeon General’s Report and followed by each subsequent Surgeon General’s Report that has included a review of the evidence on smoking and lung cancer, an enormous body of scientific evidence clearly documents that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, and that cigarette smoking is the major cause of lung cancer.</Para><Para id="_175">Based on solid evidence, cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.

mortality rates increased markedly throughout most of the 20th century, first in
men and then in women.  The trends in lung cancer incidence and mortality rates  have closely mirrored historical patterns of smoking prevalence, after accounting for an appropriate latency period. Because of historical differences in smoking prevalence between men and women, lung cancer rates in men have consistently declined  since the mid-1980s, but rates in women have only declined since the mid-2000s.<Reference refidx="2"/> The incidence rate in men declined from a high of 96.57 cases per 100,000 men in 1984 to 46.68 cases per 100,000 men in 2021.

Lung
cancer is  the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women.

effective  prevention and treatment strategies.  Two  important concepts in this regard  are the multistep nature of carcinogenesis and the diffuse field-wide
carcinogenic process.  Epithelial cancers in the lung appear to develop in a
 series of steps extending over years.  Epithelial carcinogenesis is
conceptually divided into three phases: initiation, promotion, and progression. 
This process has been inferred from human studies identifying
clinical-histological premalignant lesions (e.g., metaplasia and dysplasia).
The concept of field carcinogenesis is that multiple independent neoplastic
lesions occurring within the lung can result from repeated exposure to
carcinogens, primarily tobacco.  Patients developing cancers of the
aerodigestive tract secondary to cigarette smoke also are likely to have
multiple premalignant lesions of independent origin within the
carcinogen-exposed field.  The concepts of multistep and field carcinogenesis
provide a model for prevention studies.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8151328" MedlineID="94201805">Lippman SM, Benner SE, Hong WK: Cancer chemoprevention.

This causative link has been widely recognized since the 1960s, when national reports in Great Britain and the United States brought the cancer risk of smoking prominently to the public’s attention.<Reference refidx="2"/> The lifetime risk of lung cancer was estimated in a Swiss population to be 15%  in men who smoke and 12% in women who smoke, compared with 2% or less in nonsmokers.<Reference refidx="4"/> The percentages of lung cancers estimated to be caused by tobacco smoking in males and females are 90% and 78%, respectively. The manufactured cigarette has changed over time, but there is no evidence to suggest that changes such as <Emphasis>low tar</Emphasis> or <Emphasis>low nicotine</Emphasis> cigarettes have resulted in reduced lung cancer risks.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  Cigarette smoking is the most important contributor to the lung cancer burden because of its high prevalence of use and because cigarette smokers tend to smoke frequently, but cigar and pipe smoking have also been associated independently in case-control and cohort studies with increased lung cancer risk.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> The cigar risks are of particular concern because of the increased prevalence of cigar use in the United States.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_231">The development of lung cancer is the culmination of multistep carcinogenesis. Genetic damage caused by chronic exposure to carcinogens, such as  those in cigarette smoke, is the driving force behind the multistep process.

Health indicators including respiratory systems, sensory symptoms, and hospital admissions were reported as outcomes in 25 studies.  With respect to health outcomes, a consistent finding was reduced hospital admissions for cardiac events. Evidence suggested that smoke-free workplace legislation may also result in reduced prevalence of active cigarette smoking; for example, one study observed a 32% decreased smoking prevalence in a county that enacted smoke-free workplace legislation compared with a 2.8% decrease in nearby counties with no smoke-free workplace legislation.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_266"><Title>Preventing Occupational Exposure to Lung Carcinogens</Title><Para id="_267">After cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, occupational exposure to lung carcinogens, such as asbestos, arsenic, nickel, and chromium, is the most important contributor to the lung cancer burden. When occupational exposure to lung carcinogens are all considered together, 9% to 15% of all lung cancer deaths can be attributed to occupational exposure to lung carcinogens.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Reducing or eliminating workplace exposures to known lung carcinogens would be expected to result in a corresponding decrease in the risk of lung cancer.  Consequently, the proportion of the lung cancer burden attributable to occupational exposures is declining over time in countries like the United States that have taken steps to protect the workforce from exposure to known lung carcinogens.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">The Health Consequences of Smoking: A Report of the Surgeon General.

published in  1994.<Reference refidx="1"/>  This trial included 29,133 Finnish male chronic
smokers aged 50 to 69 years in a 2 × 2 factorial design of alpha-tocopherol (50
mg/day) and beta-carotene (20 mg/day).  Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following four
groups for 5 to 8 years: beta-carotene alone, alpha-tocopherol alone, beta-carotene plus
alpha-tocopherol, or placebo.  Participants who received beta-carotene (alone or with alpha-tocopherol) had a higher incidence of lung cancer
(relative risk [RR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–1.36) and higher
total mortality (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16).  This effect appeared to be
associated with heavier smoking (one or more packs/day) and alcohol intake
(at least one drink/day).<Reference refidx="2"/> Supplementation with
alpha-tocopherol produced no overall effect on lung cancer (RR, 0.99; 95% CI,
0.87–1.13). </Para><Para id="_271">In  1996, the results of the U.S. Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial
(CARET) were published.<Reference refidx="3"/>  This multicenter trial involved 18,314
smokers, former smokers, and asbestos-exposed workers who were randomly assigned to
beta-carotene (at a higher dose than the ATBC trial, 30 mg/day) plus retinyl
palmitate (25,000 IU/day) or placebo.  The primary endpoint was lung cancer
incidence.  The trial was terminated early by the Data Monitoring Committee and NCI because its results confirmed the ATBC finding of a harmful
effect of beta-carotene over that of placebo, which increased lung cancer incidence
(RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04–1.57) and total mortality (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 
1.03–1.33).
In a follow-up study of CARET participants after  the intervention discontinued, these effects attenuated for a period of time.  After 6 years of postintervention follow-up, the postintervention RR for lung cancer incidence was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.97–1.31) and for total mortality was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.99–1.71). During the postintervention phase a larger RR among women, rather than men, emerged for both outcomes in subgroup analyses; the reason for this observation, if reliable, is not known.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_272">The overall findings from the ATBC <Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> and CARET <Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="5"/> studies, which
include over 47,000 participants, demonstrated that pharmacological doses of beta-carotene increase lung cancer risk in relatively high-intensity smokers.  The
mechanism of this adverse effect is not known.  Lung cancer risks were not
increased in subsets of moderate-intensity smokers (less than a pack per day)
in the ATBC study, or in former smokers in the CARET study.  Evidence from other studies, such as  the Physicians’ Health Study,<Reference refidx="6"/> does not indicate that beta-carotene supplementation increases lung cancer risk in
nonsmokers.  Subsequent analyses of participants in these trials and cohorts   suggest that the beneficial outcomes
associated with high beta-carotene plasma levels may be due to increased
dietary intake of fruits and vegetables.  These findings show the importance of
randomized controlled trials to confirm epidemiological studies.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8127329" MedlineID="94173292">The effect of vitamin E and beta carotene on the incidence of lung cancer and other cancers in male smokers.

Chemoprevention is defined as the use of specific natural or synthetic chemical

So far, agents tested for efficacy in lung cancer chemoprevention have been micronutrients, such as beta-carotene and vitamin E.</Para><SummarySection id="_276"><Title>Beta-carotene supplementation in nonsmokers</Title><Para id="_277">Two other randomized controlled trials of beta-carotene were carried out in populations that were not at excess risk of lung cancer. The Physicians’ Health Study was designed to study the effects

22,071 male physicians aged 40 to 84 years. After 12 years of follow-up,

In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients aged 55 years or older with vascular disease or diabetes were assigned to 400 IU vitamin E or placebo.  With a median follow-up of 7 years, the group randomly assigned to vitamin E had a significantly lower lung cancer incidence rate (1.4%) than the placebo group (2.0%) (RR, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53–0.98).<Reference refidx="3"/>  However, the protective association between vitamin E supplements and lung cancer in the HOPE-TOO study needs to be interpreted in the context of evidence from other randomized trials.  In the National Cancer Institute Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) study, supplementation with alpha-tocopherol produced no overall effect on lung cancer (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87–1.13). In the WHS of 40,000 female health professionals, using 600 IU of vitamin E every other day showed no evidence of protection against lung cancer in women (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.83–1.44).<Reference refidx="4"/> The  Medical Research Council/British Heart Foundation   Heart Protection Study (HPS) is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test antioxidant vitamin supplementation with vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta-carotene among 20,536 United Kingdom adults with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes.
