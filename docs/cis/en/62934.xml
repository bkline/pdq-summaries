In the United States, it has been adopted by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) for sarcoma staging and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) cancer protocols for bone and soft tissue sarcomas. The WHO published a revision to their classification of soft tissue and bone tumors in 2020.  The classification had several updates to existing classification, nomenclature, grading, and risk stratification schemes.   The revised classification includes newly described entities, and it uses molecular alterations in the classifications.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_1858">The grading of soft tissue tumors has always been a controversial issue. The 2020 WHO classification represents the consensus of several soft tissue pathologists and geneticists, as well as a medical oncologist, radiologist, and surgeon. This edition further integrates morphological and genetic information into the classification. For example, a new category of tumors called <GeneName>NTRK</GeneName>-rearranged spindle cell neoplasms was included, but infantile fibrosarcoma was excluded from this group. Ewing sarcoma was removed from the bone tumor section and, instead, is in the undifferentiated small cell sarcomas of bone and soft tissue section. This classification reflects the variable presentation sites and the variety of translocations seen in Ewing sarcoma. This classification also separated Ewing sarcoma from entities such as <GeneName>CIC</GeneName>-rearranged sarcomas, <GeneName>BCOR</GeneName>-rearranged sarcomas, and <GeneName>EWSR1</GeneName> gene fusions involving non-ETS partner genes.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><OrderedList id="_1219" Style="Arabic"><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062934#_551"

behavior.  Therefore, several histological parameters are evaluated in the grading process, including the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_1200" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Degree of
cellularity.</ListItem><ListItem>Cellular pleomorphism.</ListItem><ListItem>Mitotic activity.</ListItem><ListItem>Degree of necrosis.</ListItem><ListItem>Invasive growth.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_1201">This process
is used to improve the correlation between histological findings and clinical
outcome.<Reference refidx="9"/>  In children, grading of soft tissue sarcoma is complicated by certain factors, such as prognosis, patient age, extent of surgical resection, and ability to metastasize. For example,  children younger than 4 years with infantile fibrosarcoma and hemangiopericytoma have a good prognosis, and angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans can recur locally if incompletely excised but usually do not metastasize.</Para><Para id="_650">Testing the validity of a grading system within the pediatric population is
difficult because of the rarity of these neoplasms.  In 1986, the Pediatric
Oncology Group (POG) conducted a prospective study on pediatric NRSTS and devised the POG grading system.  Analysis of outcomes for patients with localized NRSTS demonstrated that patients with grade 3
tumors fared significantly worse than those with grade 1 or grade 2
lesions.  This finding suggests that this system can accurately predict the
clinical behavior of NRSTS.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/> </Para><Para id="_458">The POG and Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre Le Cancer (FNCLCC) grading systems have proven to be of prognostic value in
pediatric and adult NRSTS.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/> The COG uses the FNCLCC clinically. In a study of 130 tumors from  children and adolescents with NRSTS enrolled in three prospective clinical trials, a correlation was found between the POG-assigned grade and the FNCLCC-assigned grade. However, grading did not correlate in all cases; 44 patients whose tumors received discrepant grades (POG grade 3, FNCLCC grade 1 or 2) had outcomes between concurrent grade 3 and grades 1 and 2. A mitotic index of 10 or greater emerged as an important prognostic factor.<Reference refidx="17"/> </Para><Para id="_1986">The COG <ProtocolRef nct_id="NCT00346164">ARST0332 (NCT00346164)</ProtocolRef> trial compared the POG and FNCLCC pathological grading systems as part of a prospective risk-based strategy.

In the COG ARST0332 study, if the central review surgeon deemed the tumor unresectable without loss of limb, form, or function, the patient was treated in arm C  with neoadjuvant radiation therapy. Surgery was performed 4 to 6 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy. This early surgery allowed for decreased morbidity, better wound healing, and more complete surgical resection. The outcomes in the COG ARST0332 study were nearly identical for intermediate-risk patients who achieved an R0 or R1 resection with up-front surgery or surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (70% vs. 71%, respectively). An R0 resection was more likely to occur after neoadjuvant therapy.<Reference refidx="1"/> These observations are true even for high-grade tumors, where the ability to achieve R0 or R1 resections was the major predictor of EFS. Treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy resulted in lower doses of radiation therapy and achieved greater rates of R0 resections.<Reference refidx="3"/> Resectability should be determined at the time of diagnosis.

cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:</Para><ItemizedList id="_1331" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Primary care physicians.</ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric surgeons.</ListItem><ListItem>Pathologists.</ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric radiation oncologists. </ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.</ListItem><ListItem>Rehabilitation specialists.</ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric oncology nurses.</ListItem><ListItem>Social workers.</ListItem><ListItem>Child-life professionals.</ListItem><ListItem>Psychologists.</ListItem><ListItem>Nutritionists.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_1332">For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care">Supportive and Palliative Care</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_1333">The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for pediatric cancer
centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents with cancer.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At these centers, clinical trials are available for most types of cancer
that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Multidisciplinary evaluation in pediatric cancer centers that have surgical and radiotherapeutic expertise is of critical importance to ensure the best clinical outcome for these patients. Although surgery with or without radiation therapy can be curative for a significant proportion of patients, the addition of chemotherapy might benefit subsets of children with the disease. Therefore, enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged. Clinical trials for
children and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to compare
potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. 
Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative therapies for
childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.  Information about
ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials">NCI website</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_405">Many therapeutic strategies for children and adolescents with soft tissue tumors are
similar to those for adult patients, although there are important differences. 
For example, the biology of the neoplasm in pediatric patients may differ
dramatically from that of the adult lesion.  Additionally, limb-sparing procedures are more
difficult to perform in pediatric patients.  The morbidity associated with radiation therapy, particularly in infants and young children, may be much greater than that observed in
adults.<Reference refidx="3"/> </Para><Para id="_655">Improved outcomes with multimodality therapy in adults and children with soft tissue sarcomas over the past 20 years have caused increasing concern about the potential long-term side effects of this therapy
in children. To
maximize tumor control and minimize long-term morbidity, treatment must be
individualized for children and adolescents with nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcoma.  These patients should be enrolled in prospective studies that
accurately assess any potential complications.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="24853691">Smith MA, Altekruse SF, Adamson PC, et al.: Declining childhood and adolescent cancer mortality.

Surgery was performed 4 to 6 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy. This early surgery allowed for decreased morbidity, better wound healing, and more complete surgical resection. Also revised text to state that while there should be an emphasis on achieving negative margins without loss of form or function, given the variability of chemosensitivity of such diverse tumors, it may be better to tailor the resection to histology for each patient.</Para><Para id="_2891"><Strong><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062934#_558" url="/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/hp/child-soft-tissue-treatment-pdq">Treatment of Fibroblastic and Myofibroblastic Tumors</SummaryRef></Strong></Para><Para id="_2892">Added <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062934#_2605" url="/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/hp/child-soft-tissue-treatment-pdq">text</SummaryRef> about the results of a COG trial of larotrectinib in 33 children with <GeneName>NTRK</GeneName> fusion–positive solid tumors, including 18 patients with infantile fibrosarcoma (cited Laetsch et al. as reference 100).</Para><Para id="_2893">Added <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062934#_2870" url="/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/hp/child-soft-tissue-treatment-pdq">text</SummaryRef> to state that a study by the Ultra-Rare Sarcoma Working Group examined 32 patients with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and rare occurrences of distant metastases.
