Initially, mutations do not change the histological appearance of the tissue, but accumulated mutations will result in hyperplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>, and eventually, invasive cancer.<Reference refidx="2"/> The longer a woman lives, the more somatic mutations occur, and the more likely it is that these mutations will produce populations of cells that may eventually become malignancies. Estrogen and progestin hormones, whether endogenous or exogenous, stimulate growth and proliferation of breast cells, perhaps via growth factors such as transforming growth factor-alpha.<Reference refidx="3"/> The stimulation by these hormones can promote the development and proliferation of breast cancer cells. 
</Para><Para id="_36">International variation in breast cancer rates may be explained by differences in genetics, reproductive factors, diet, exercise, and screening behavior.  The relative importance of these factors was demonstrated in a study of breast cancer incidence of Japanese immigrants to the United States.  Whereas Japanese women in Japan had a low breast cancer incidence, Japanese women in the United States had a much higher breast cancer incidence, similar to that of American women, within two generations of migration.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>

Because so  many factors must be considered, any  observed associations can be easily confounded by the analytical problems of multiplicities, measurement challenges, and recall and publication bias.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> Additionally, although a specific environmental exposure might be determined to have the <Emphasis>potential</Emphasis> to be harmful as observed in an animal model or other toxicological studies using high-dose exposures, this does not necessarily mean that the substance, under conditions in which the general human population is exposed, leads to adverse health outcomes. The ultimate risk to human health depends not only on the intrinsic toxic potential of the substance, but also on the dose or amount the population is exposed to and the timing or length of time of the exposure. Overall, available human studies evaluating potential associations between breast cancer and specific environmental exposures are not conclusive.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8899264" MedlineID="97054975">Breast cancer and hormonal contraceptives: further results.

Findings from observational studies have varied; some studies showed an association, while other studies did not. Observational studies that support this association were less rigorous and  potentially biased because of differential recall by women on a socially sensitive issue.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> For example, the impact of recall or reporting bias was demonstrated in a study that compared regions with different social attitudes on abortion.<Reference refidx="5"/> The Committee on Gynecologic Practice of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has concluded that “more rigorous recent studies demonstrate no causal relationship between induced abortion and a subsequent increase in breast cancer risk.”<Reference refidx="6"/> Studies that used prospectively recorded data regarding abortion, thereby avoiding recall bias, largely showed no association with the subsequent development of breast cancer.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_645"><Title>Diet</Title><Para id="_647">There is little evidence that dietary modifications of any kind have an impact on the incidence of breast cancer.</Para><Para id="_710">Very few randomized trials in humans compare cancer incidence for different diets. Most studies are observational—including post hoc analyses of randomized trials—and are subject to biases that may be so large as to render the observation difficult to interpret. In particular, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> values and confidence intervals (CIs) do not have the same interpretation as when calculated for the primary end point in a randomized trial.</Para><Para id="_648">A summary of ecological studies published before 1975 showed a positive correlation between international age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rates and the estimated per capita consumption of dietary fat.<Reference refidx="13"/> Results of case-control studies have been mixed.  Twenty years later, a pooled analysis of results from seven cohort studies found no association between total dietary fat intake and breast cancer risk.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_649">A randomized, controlled, dietary modification study was undertaken among 48,835 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years who were also enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative. The intervention promoted a goal of reducing total fat intake by 20% by increasing vegetable, fruit, and grain consumption. The intervention group reduced fat intake by approximately 10% for more than 8.1 years of follow-up, resulting in lower estradiol and gamma-tocopherol levels, but no persistent weight loss. The incidence of invasive breast cancer was numerically, but not statistically lower in the intervention group, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.83–1.01).<Reference refidx="15"/> There was no difference in all-cause mortality, overall mortality, or the incidence of  cardiovascular events.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_715">With regard to fruit and vegetable intake, a pooled analysis of eight cohort studies including more than 350,000 women with 7,377 incident breast cancers showed little or no association for various assumed statistical models.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_651">The Women's Healthy Eating and Living Randomized Trial <Reference refidx="18"/> examined the effect of diet on the incidence of new primary breast cancers in women previously diagnosed with breast cancer. More than 3,000 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to an intense regimen of increased fruit and vegetable intake, increased fiber intake, and decreased fat intake, or a comparison group receiving printed materials on the “5-A-Day” dietary guidelines. After a mean of 7.3 years of follow-up, there was no reduction in new primary cancers, no difference in disease-free survival, and no difference in overall survival.</Para><Para id="_711">A randomized trial in Spain <Reference refidx="19"/>  assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control Mediterranean diet (counseling to reduce dietary fat). The investigators reported a statistically significant reduction in major cardiovascular events, which was the trial’s primary end point.<Reference refidx="20"/> The investigators also addressed other end points, including the incidence of breast cancer, although it is not specified how many were examined. Based on only 35 cases of invasive breast cancer (as compared with 288 major cardiovascular events), the respective rates of breast cancer were 8 of 1,476 (0.54%); 10 of 1,285 (0.78%); and 17 of 1,391 (1.22%) with respective average follow-up durations of 4.8, 4.3, and 4.2 years.

A phase III Italian trial compared the efficacy of a 5-year intervention with fenretinide versus no treatment in 2,972 women, aged 30 to 70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or DCIS. At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .642), ipsilateral breast cancer (<Emphasis>P </Emphasis>= .177), incidence of distant metastases, nonbreast malignancies, and all-cause mortality.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_672"><Title>Active and Passive Cigarette Smoking</Title><Para id="_673">The potential role of active cigarette smoking in the etiology of breast cancer has been studied for more than three decades, with no clear-cut evidence of an association.<Reference refidx="27"/>  Since the mid-1990s, studies of cigarette smoking and breast cancer have more carefully accounted for secondhand smoke exposure.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/> A recent meta-analysis suggests that there is no overall association between passive smoking and breast cancer and that study methodology (ascertainment of exposure after breast cancer diagnosis) may be responsible for the apparent risk associations seen in some studies.<Reference refidx="29"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_674"><Title>Underarm Deodorants/Antiperspirants</Title><Para id="_675">Despite warnings to women in lay publications that underarm deodorants and antiperspirants cause breast cancer, there is no evidence to support these concerns.

It is likely that this finding could be explained by differences in endogenous hormones rather than shaving and antiperspirant/deodorant use.  Early menarche and increased body hair are both associated with increased levels of endogenous hormones, known to be risk factors for breast cancer.<Reference refidx="31"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_676"><Title>Statins</Title><Para id="_677">Two well-conducted meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) <Reference refidx="32"/> and RCTs plus observational studies <Reference refidx="33"/> found no evidence that statin use either increases or decreases the risk of breast cancer.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_685"><Title>Bisphosphonates</Title><Para id="_686">Oral and intravenous bisphosphonates for the treatment of hypercalcemia and osteoporosis have been studied for a possible beneficial effect on breast cancer prevention.

In particular, the confidence intervals for the incidence rate ratios were narrow, even for 20 years or more of night shift work (rate ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93–1.10).

They followed women for an average of 6.1 years and observed 1,775 breast cancers. Adjusting for potentially confounding factors, including night shift work, they found no evidence that the amount of bedroom light at night was associated with breast cancer risk.
