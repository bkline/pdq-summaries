psychosocial distress.  Although there are notable differences, most models
involve the following sequential steps:</Para><ItemizedList id="_710" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Screening administration.</ListItem><ListItem>Scoring and evaluation.</ListItem><ListItem>Referral.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_711">Most screening for psychosocial distress focuses on the individual patient. However, some family-focused screening procedures are being developed.<Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_712">Administration of a screening instrument involves a 5- to 10-minute
process in which a patient answers a series of simple, straightforward
questions about distress, either orally or via a self-report paper or
computer questionnaire.  Answers are scored and evaluated based on previously
determined criteria.  If scores fall above the defined criteria, then a formal
referral to the appropriate discipline (social work, psychology, psychiatry,
palliative care, or pastoral care) is made.  Distress management then begins with
a more-comprehensive face-to-face psychosocial assessment interview <Reference refidx="1"/> by a
qualified health care professional appropriate to the issues identified.</Para><Para id="_713">The success of screening programs can be measured in terms of the following outcomes:</Para><ItemizedList id="_714" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Accurate identification of patients who are experiencing significant psychosocial distress.</ListItem><ListItem>Improved referral of patients to appropriate health care professionals to address clinically relevant distress.</ListItem><ListItem>Patient acceptance of such referrals.</ListItem><ListItem>	Improved patient-clinician communication, with frequent discussion of quality-of-life issues during patient visits.</ListItem><ListItem>Decreased level of distress and improved quality of life resulting from the screening program.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_715">Some empirical studies have evaluated the impact of structured screening programs using these outcomes. In most of these studies, the intervention included telephone follow-up of screening results with referrals or in-person discussions with clinicians, trained or untrained in screening. Study designs have differed in terms of screening tools (brief vs. comprehensive screening tools), intervention components (trained vs. untrained screening clinicians), and study outcomes. Study designs have also differed in their controls. For example, control groups in some studies did not undergo screening,<Reference refidx="28"/> while others involved patient screening but with no results conveyed to clinicians.<Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_716">The results of these screening studies have been mixed, depending on the structure of the screening programs and the assessed outcomes. Two studies found no meaningful differences between control and intervention groups in distress, quality of life, or cancer needs.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/> Low patient acceptance of psychosocial referral services was one of the limitations identified in these studies.<Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_717"> In one study, a subgroup of moderately to severely depressed patients showed a significant reduction in depression after the intervention,<Reference refidx="29"/> while another study concluded that the best predictor of decreased anxiety/depression was referral to psychosocial services.<Reference refidx="30"/> Another study showed the feasibility of implementing a personalized and computerized screening program in a large patient population (N = 3,133) at a tertiary cancer center.<Reference refidx="31"/></Para><Para id="_718">Given these mixed results, further empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of screening programs is necessary. The following examples illustrate the process.</Para><Para id="_719">Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has experimented with the DT, which was modeled after tools used to
measure pain.<Reference refidx="9"/>  The descriptive anchor points on the DT include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_720" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>No distress at a rating of 0.</ListItem><ListItem>Extreme distress at a rating of 10.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_721">Patients are asked to rate the
distress they experienced during the past week, including the day of the screening, on a scale of 0 to 10. Accompanying the DT is a
problem checklist that helps identify potential sources of stress.  The patient is  asked to check the problems that are most relevant.  Categories of problems include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_722" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Practical (e.g., housing, insurance,
or transportation).</ListItem><ListItem>Physical (e.g., pain, nausea, or fatigue).</ListItem><ListItem>Social
(e.g., partner, children, or friends).</ListItem><ListItem>Emotional (e.g., worry, sadness,
depression, or anger).</ListItem><ListItem>Spiritual/religious (e.g., relating to God or loss of
faith).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_723">The primary oncology team (oncologist, nurse, palliative care
specialist, and social worker) is responsible for administering this brief screening,  evaluating a
patient’s response, and arranging for a  referral, when
necessary.  Preliminary testing of this procedure used a cutoff score of 4 or
higher for requiring further evaluation.  Initial needs assessments have shown
that 20% to 62% of patients reported significant levels of distress.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_724">At Johns Hopkins Cancer Center, all new patients receive an 18-item version of the Brief
Symptom Inventory),<Reference refidx="14"/> which lists 18 problems people may experience
(e.g., feeling faint or dizzy, having no interest in things, loneliness, or nausea or
upset stomach).  Patients are asked how much they were distressed by each of the
18 problems during the past 7 days, including the day of the screening.  The automated procedure uses clerical and support staff to distribute and
retrieve the inventory during the first or second visit.<Reference refidx="2"/>  The professional staff is involved when offering further services.  Patients screened as having high levels of distress are referred to a
social worker for immediate follow-up. Those screened as having low
levels of distress are referred to the psychosocial orientation program, a structured educational program designed to enhance patient adaptation by providing information about a range of psychosocial programs (e.g.,
disease-specific support groups or psychoeducational presentations).</Para><Para id="_725">The Oncology Symptom Control Research group at Community Cancer Care typically
screens all incoming patients with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale
(ZSDS).<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/>  The ZSDS is a 20-item self-report that has been
used to detect depression and more-general distress; single items are also used
to screen for conditions such as fatigue.<Reference refidx="34"/>  Staff members typically administer the
screen while patients are in the waiting room.  Scores are analyzed immediately
after completion so that medical oncologists can be briefed on any
pertinent issues.  In addition, patients scoring in the moderate range or
higher are identified for further follow-up and more-extensive interviews and
assessment by the staff psychiatrist or psychologist.  Also, patients
who trigger single items of interest, such as fatigue, are interviewed and
monitored for possible inclusion in a number of symptom-control research trials.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Nicholas DR, Veach TA: The psychosocial assessment of the adult cancer patient.

importance.</Para><Para id="_660"><Strong>Coping</Strong> refers to the specific thoughts and behaviors that patients use to adjust to cancer.<Reference refidx="2"/> One cognitive theory of coping <Reference refidx="4"/> proposes that in response to significant
life events, a person asks two important questions:</Para><ItemizedList id="_661" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Is this event personally
significant to me?</ListItem><ListItem>What resources do I have to manage/control this
event?</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_662">A low level of distress is
the result of a perception that either the demands of a situation are  low
or the individual’s resources are substantial.<Reference refidx="5"/> Therefore, to lower distress levels, either the perceived demands of a situation should be lowered, or the
perceived resources should be increased.</Para><Para id="_663"><Strong>Coping strategies</Strong> refer to specific cognitive and behavioral activities that use 
situation-specific coping efforts to adjust, such as readjusting one’s daily routine or
work schedule to adjust to the side effects of cancer treatment.
Among many

     <ListItem> <Strong>Problem-focused
strategies</Strong> help patients manage specific problems by directly trying to alter
problematic situations.

understand why an event has happened and what impact cancer will have on their
lives.  In general, people who adjust well typically remain committed to and
actively engaged in coping with cancer and continue to find
meaning and importance in their lives.  People who do not adjust
well often withdraw, become disengaged, and feel hopeless.  Assessing the
degree of engagement versus giving up may be a way to distinguish between
successful and unsuccessful adjustment.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_665">Patients may switch among these strategies, even from adaptive to maladaptive, depending on their current functioning levels.</Para><Para id="_9"><Strong>Coping style</Strong> refers to the most-common, more-frequent, and longer-term use of a set of coping strategies that an individual tends to use across a variety of life situations (e.g., use of alcohol, seeking social support, use of religious/spirituality resources).  Coping style is often closely
related to overall disposition and personality (e.g., optimism,
pessimism, introversion, extroversion).<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_667">One criticism of the literature focuses on the assumption that coping with cancer is a unitary, single event.  In reality, coping with cancer involves coping styles and strategies that may vary according to the nature of the stressors being encountered.  For example, in a study of 52 adults receiving palliative care for cancer,<Reference refidx="10"/> patients participated in a semistructured interview during which they were asked how they coped with their most significant stressors.  Results showed that most participants used a range of coping strategies. However, there were interactions between stressor domains (existential, psychosocial, physical) and coping categories (problem focused, emotion focused, emotion avoidant). Problem-focused strategies were used less frequently for the existential stressors, while emotion-focused strategies were used less frequently for the physical stressors.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><SummarySection id="_15"><Title>General Factors Influencing Adjustment</Title><Para id="_16">Although there are common factors in normal adjustment to the varying
stressors of cancer, there are also many individual differences.  It is
difficult to predict how a given patient will cope with cancer, so it is important
to recognize factors that influence adjustment to cancer. One study of  women with stage II or stage III breast cancer <Reference refidx="11"/> reported that higher levels of stress (including both cancer and noncancer stressors) measured at the time of diagnosis and again after surgery predicted lower physical and psychological quality of life.</Para><Para id="_402">Another study evaluated women with stage 0 to stage  III breast cancer (N = 89) at three time points: during treatment, 3 weeks after the end of treatment, and 3 months posttreatment. Most survivors showed good adjustment on general distress indices. The factors predicting sustained distress included younger age, history of depression or anxiety, and more-extensive treatment.<Reference refidx="12"/> </Para><Para id="_403">Psychosocial
adjustment/adaptation is influenced by three broad
categories of factors: cancer derived, patient derived, and society derived.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_409">The personality traits of optimism and pessimism might play a critical role in the psychological well-being of patients with cancer.  A German study investigated the impact of optimism and pessimism on psychological well-being in 161 patients who were newly diagnosed with heterogeneous cancers.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Patients were assessed for optimism/pessimism and  positive/negative emotions before their first chemotherapy session and at 9 months’ follow-up.  Before the start of chemotherapy, psychological well-being was associated with higher levels of optimism and lower levels of pessimism.  At the 9-month follow-up, pessimism predicted negative changes in psychological well-being as well as heightened experiences of chemotherapy-related side effects.</Para><Para id="_209">The availability of social support has been found to be related to mortality from breast cancer.  In a longitudinal study of 2,835 female nurses with breast cancer, those who reported no close contacts (e.g., relatives, friends, or living children) before their diagnosis had a twofold increased risk of mortality from breast cancer, compared with those who had more social contacts (e.g., ten or more close relatives).<Reference refidx="14"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_17"><Title>Situation-Specific Influences on Adjustment</Title><SummarySection id="_86"><Title>Hearing the diagnosis</Title><Para id="_19">The process of adjusting to cancer can begin even before a diagnosis.

unexplained symptoms or when they realize that they are undergoing testing to
determine the presence of cancer.  When they hear the diagnosis, their fears
become realized, generating a psychological and existential plight
(crisis).<Reference refidx="15"/>  Because of the effect that heightened distress (secondary to adjustment to cancer) can have on attention and cognitive processing, communication with patients about  their cancer diagnosis may be impaired.<Reference refidx="16"/> During this time, it can be helpful to provide additional professional support to address problems such as fatigue, insomnia, and depressed mood, which are associated with adjustment to cancer and may also affect patient-provider interactions and quality of life.<Reference refidx="17"/> For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000618162" url="/about-cancer/coping/adjusting-to-cancer/communication-hp-pdq">Communication in Cancer Care</SummaryRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_87"><Title>Active treatment</Title><Para id="_668">Longer-term adaptation takes place over an extended time, during which

emotional consequences (e.g., re-entry into the patient role and renewed
feelings of loss of control).  Many patients find waiting for test results
to be a particularly distressing experience.</Para><Para id="_190"> For most individuals, this normal escalation of distress after treatment ends appears to be temporary and resolves within a few weeks. In an empirical study of posttreatment adjustment, 94 women with stage 0, I, II, or III breast cancer who were completing radiation therapy were assessed on measures of depression, anxiety, and quality of life on the last day of treatment and at 2 weeks, 4 to 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months posttreatment.

patient who successfully adjusts to the crisis of recurrence often shifts
expectations and maintains hope through a variety of meaningful life activities. 
For example, a patient who believes that pain and suffering can be
controlled will have hope for future quality of life.  Religion and spirituality also play an important role in helping
many patients maintain mental and physical quality of life.  Providers may wish to screen for spiritual health at this stage of cancer to make appropriate referrals.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/> For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000328116" url="/about-cancer/coping/day-to-day/faith-and-spirituality/spirituality-hp-pdq">Spirituality in Cancer Care</SummaryRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_89"><Title>Advanced cancer and noncurative treatment

more than 4,000 patients.<Reference refidx="29"/>  Diagnoses in all of the studies were made via criteria of the <Emphasis>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</Emphasis> (DSM) or the <Emphasis>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</Emphasis> (ICD).

The meta-analysis found major mood disorder or depression in 24.6% of the palliative care population and some form of anxiety disorder in 9.8% of patients.  Milder mental health concerns, such as adjustment disorder (with anxiety and/or depressive features), were found in 24.7% of patients.<Reference refidx="29"/> For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Depression</SummaryRef> and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062793" url="/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/new-normal/ptsd-hp-pdq">Cancer-Related Post-Traumatic Stress</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_860">How patients with advanced cancer perceive their prognosis may be one reason for psychosocial distress. In a cross-sectional, descriptive study of 559 patients with incurable cancer, patients completed the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).<Reference refidx="30"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] The authors defined clinically significant symptoms of depression or anxiety as having a score of more than 7 on the HADS depression or anxiety subscale.

An important limitation of this study is that the authors did not assess clinicians’ treatment goals or patients’ treatment status. In addition, the study was conducted at a single cancer center with a predominantly White, non-Hispanic sample. Nevertheless, the findings highlight the importance of patient-centered communication and psychosocial support, particularly when discussing goals of care.

gradual and extends over many years.  However, despite various
cancer diagnoses and treatments, most patients adjust well, with some even reporting
benefits of a cancer diagnosis (e.g., greater appreciation of life,
reprioritizing of life values, strengthening of spiritual or religious
beliefs).<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/>  Patients who have poorer adjustment tend to have the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_775" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Greater

adjustment.</ListItem><ListItem>Fewer economic resources.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_36">In general, studies of cancer survivors and healthy comparison groups have
found no significant differences in measures of psychological distress, marital
and sexual adjustment, social functioning, and overall psychosocial
functioning.</Para><Para id="_731">However, many cancer survivors experience some common areas of distress that are subthreshold or not severe enough to meet
diagnostic criteria, including:<Reference refidx="35"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_776" Style="bullet">

Survivors at risk of high levels of fear of recurrence included women, individuals younger than 59 years, those at 5 to 7 years postdiagnosis, socially isolated individuals, those with lower education levels, and individuals with a history of metastases or recurrence.<Reference refidx="36"/></Para><Para id="_178">In one of the few prospective longitudinal studies of cancer survivors, 752 survivors from three U.S. states were asked about a variety of psychosocial problems.  About 1 year after diagnosis, 68% felt fearful that their illness would return, approximately 60% were concerned about relapse, and 58% had fears about the future.  In addition, approximately two out of three survivors were concerned about a physical health problem, such as fatigue and loss of strength.  Approximately 48% reported sleep difficulties, and 41% reported concerns with sexual dysfunction.  Survivors who were younger (aged 18–54 years), female, non-White, unmarried, or who had lower incomes reported more problems.  In comparisons of four common cancers, the most concerns regarding problems in living were reported by those with lung cancer, followed by survivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers.<Reference refidx="37"/></Para><Para id="_861">Referral to psycho-oncology services may benefit patients during survivorship. A prospective observational study of 243 adults referred for psycho-oncology services assessed the impact of one or two visits for pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy on depression and distress.<Reference refidx="38"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Patients were seen an average of 2.5 years after diagnosis. Depression was measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and distress was measured with the Distress Thermometer. Participants' depression and distress scores were significantly lower at the second visit than at baseline. The differences in scores were clinically meaningful and did not differ by clinician type (prescriber or nonprescriber).</Para><Para id="_748">Multifocal interventions may help cancer survivors address multiple mental and physical health issues simultaneously.  In a multicenter trial of 222 posttreatment breast cancer survivors, researchers implemented the Better Exercise Adherence after Treatment for Cancer (BEAT Cancer) intervention. In this study, over 3 months, patients engaged in 12 supervised exercise sessions that were tapered to an unsupervised at-home exercise program (though logged with a heart rate monitor), individual counseling sessions, and group counseling. These sessions encouraged regular exercise, promoted self-monitoring, and engaged patients in cognitive reframing of current physical limitations, which had a significant positive impact on body image, mood, cardiovascular fitness, and general quality of life.<Reference refidx="39"/></Para><Para id="_210">A large longitudinal study of women breast cancer survivors older than 65 years (N = 660) investigated factors associated with changes in emotional well-being.  Overall findings suggested that the 5-year survivorship experience for most women was relatively stable, with few changes in emotional well-being.  However, women who had fewer than 12 years of formal education and women who perceived themselves as  never being cured were more likely to experience declines in emotional well-being. In contrast, those who had better physical functioning, good emotional support, and the perception of positive physician-patient communication were less likely to have poor emotional health.<Reference refidx="40"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="11180573" MedlineID="21110805">Brennan J: Adjustment to cancer - coping or personal transition?

However, nine of the studies showed no significant differences in survival, while one  <Reference refidx="37"/> found a survival advantage of about 1 year. This one positive trial was able to stratify groups on a number of important variables (e.g., nodal status, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status, and menopausal status) and provided data in support of possible mechanisms, such as enhanced immune functioning and patient compliance with stress reduction procedures. In an analysis of results, this study identified the complexity of factors involved in any survival benefit and the possibility that immune system–mediated benefits may contribute to increased survival when other factors are carefully considered.</Para><Para id="_694">In summary, the preponderance of evidence indicates that despite evidence of improved quality of life,   psychosocial interventions are unlikely to contribute independently to survival time in patients with cancer.

exclusively with adjustment disorder, in which the primary intervention was some
form of pharmacotherapy.  Given the nature of the adjustment disorders,
clinical experience suggests that, if available, an initial trial of short-term counseling or
psychotherapy designed to alter or eliminate the identified stressor (and thus
alleviate symptoms) should be tried before pharmacotherapy.<Reference refidx="39"/></Para><Para id="_493">However, sometimes the adjustment disorder progresses to a more-severe
mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder) and warrants
consideration of pharmacotherapy.  In addition, when the patient does not
benefit from short-term psychotherapy, adding an appropriate psychotropic
medication for a brief period of time (e.g., 2–3 weeks for antianxiety
medications, 12 months for antidepressants) may facilitate the psychotherapy,
allowing the patient to better use available coping strategies.  The
specific pattern of emotional or behavioral symptoms will determine which type
of psychotropic medication to consider.  For more information, see

another impending medical event, such as myocardial infarction, infection, or
pneumonia.  Sepsis and electrolyte abnormalities can also cause anxiety
symptoms.  Sudden anxiety with chest pain or respiratory distress may suggest a
pulmonary embolism.  Patients who are hypoxic can experience anxiety; they may
fear that they are suffocating.</Para><Para id="_265">Many drugs can precipitate anxiety in  people who are ill.  For example,
corticosteroids can produce motor restlessness, agitation, and mania as well as
depression and thoughts of suicide.  Bronchodilators and B-adrenergic receptor
stimulants used for chronic respiratory conditions can cause anxiety,
irritability, and tremulousness.  Akathisia, or motor restlessness accompanied by
subjective feelings of distress, is a side effect of neuroleptic drugs, which
are commonly used for control of emesis.  In addition, withdrawal from opioids,
benzodiazepines, barbiturates, nicotine, and alcohol can result in anxiety,
agitation, and behaviors that may be problematic for patients in
active treatment.</Para><Para id="_266">Certain tumor sites can produce symptoms that resemble anxiety disorders. 
Pheochromocytomas and pituitary microadenomas can present as episodes of panic
and anxiety.<Reference refidx="17"/>  Non–hormone-secreting pancreatic cancers can cause anxiety

known as needle phobia) or claustrophobia (for example, during a magnetic resonance imaging scan). 
Phobias can complicate medical procedures and can result in the refusal of
necessary medical intervention or tests.<Reference refidx="5"/>
 Phobias generally respond well to  exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_277"><Title>Panic disorder</Title><Para id="_278">In panic disorder, intense, rapid-onset anxiety is the predominant symptom, virtually always accompanied by severe somatic

10 to 20 minutes, although the psychological discomfort and fear of recurrence may last longer. Patients with panic attacks often present with
symptoms that can be difficult to differentiate from other medical disorders,

or images (obsessions) and by repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors
(compulsions) that a person  performs to manage his or her intense distress. 
To qualify as OCD, the obsessive thoughts and
compulsive behaviors must be time-consuming and sufficiently distracting to
interfere with the person’s ability to function in employment, academic, or
social situations.</Para><Para id="_472">Patients with cancer who have a history of OCD may engage in compulsive behaviors such as hand washing,
checking, or counting to such an extent that they cannot comply with treatment. 
For such patients, normal worry about the cancer diagnosis and prognosis can
develop into full obsessive-compulsive symptoms and be severely disabling.
OCD is most often managed with serotonergic
antidepressant medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  [SSRIs] and
clomipramine) and CBT.  Milder obsessive thoughts or use of rituals that do not interfere with treatment  might be addressed with CBT, but medications are not indicated. This disorder is rare in
cancer patients who do not have a premorbid history of some type of anxiety disorder.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_695"><Title>Health anxiety disorder</Title><Para id="_696">Cancer survivors have been known to develop health anxiety disorder related to their fears of recurrence, including:<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_784" Style="bullet">

Some  indications and safety considerations for the use of benzodiazepines in patients with cancer include the following:<Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_534" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Short-acting benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam and lorazepam, can be effectively used to provide short-term relief at specific points in the cancer continuum of diagnosis, treatment, and recurrence. Examples of such short-term use include the treatment of anxiety during diagnostic procedures (e.g., certain radioimaging procedures) and about pending test results (e.g., for yearly mammograms in  patients with a history of breast cancer).</ListItem><ListItem>Cancer treatments, such as intensive chemotherapeutic regimens, can cause significant physical and emotional distress and exacerbate anxiety. Short-acting or intermediate-acting agents (e.g., clonazepam) can provide significant relief of anxiety and other symptoms, such as insomnia secondary to anxiety, during active cancer treatments.</ListItem><ListItem>Longer-acting medications (e.g., diazepam and  clorazepate) should generally be avoided because of their long half-lives. These medications can cause or exacerbate cognitive impairment, disorientation, and drowsiness because of their potential for accumulation.</ListItem><ListItem>Patients with medical conditions such as delirium can present with anxiety and agitation. Benzodiazepine use in patients with such conditions is contraindicated because these agents can cause or exacerbate confusion and disorientation.</ListItem><ListItem>All patients, especially older adult patients, receiving benzodiazepines should be closely monitored for cognitive impairment, daytime sedation, and fall risks. Use of these agents should be optimized in patients who are older, have multiple comorbidities or liver disease, or are taking multiple medications.</ListItem><ListItem>	Use of these agents should be closely monitored and optimized in patients receiving other sedating medications, central nervous system  depressants, or agents with potential for causing respiratory depression (e.g., opiates).</ListItem><ListItem>	It is important to continuously monitor and reevaluate anxiety symptoms in all patients receiving benzodiazepines. Use of these medications can be tapered off if anxiety symptoms resolve after cancer treatment ends.</ListItem><ListItem>	In some patients, the use of benzodiazepines is continued (as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment) over a longer period (&gt;4 months) because of persistent and debilitating anxiety symptoms. It is important to monitor the development of tolerance, abuse, and dependence issues as well as comorbid depressive symptoms in such patients. Long-term and sometimes chronic use of these agents might be indicated in a subpopulation of patients, with close monitoring and frequent risk-benefit assessments. Persistent (after 3 or 4 months) anxiety symptoms frequently lead to depression. Patients with persistent anxiety symptoms with or without depression might benefit from alternative treatments (e.g., paroxetine, sertraline).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Table id="_726"><Title>Table 4.

id="_290">The choice of a benzodiazepine depends on the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_482" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Duration
of action that is best suited to the patient.</ListItem><ListItem>Desired rapidity of onset.</ListItem><ListItem>Route of administration available.</ListItem><ListItem>Presence or absence of
active metabolites.</ListItem><ListItem>Metabolic problems.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_483">Dosing schedules depend on patient
tolerance and require individual titration.  The shorter-acting benzodiazepines
(alprazolam and lorazepam) are given 3 to 4 times per day.  Short-acting
benzodiazepines, particularly those that can be administered by multiple routes
(lorazepam and diazepam), are effective for high levels of distress. 
Benzodiazepines decrease daytime anxiety and reduce insomnia.  The most common side
effects of benzodiazepines are dose dependent and are controlled by titrating
the dose to avoid drowsiness, confusion, motor incoordination, and sedation. For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062746" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/sleep-disorders-hp-pdq">Sleep Disorders</SummaryRef>.  </Para><Para id="_524"><Strong>All benzodiazepines can cause some degree of respiratory depression, which is generally minimal in patients who have not used benzodiazepines in the past. Benzodiazepines should be used cautiously (or not at all) in cases of respiratory impairment.</Strong></Para><Para id="_525">Standard precautions should be considered when any sedative is used in patients who have borderline respiratory function. Ongoing assessment of this population is important. Low doses of the antihistamine hydroxyzine (25 mg, 2–3 times a day) can be used safely in such situations. In patients with hepatic dysfunction, it is best to use short-acting benzodiazepines that are metabolized primarily by conjugation and excreted by the kidneys (e.g., oxazepam, temazepam, or lorazepam). Another advantage of using lorazepam is its lack of active metabolites. Conversely, other benzodiazepines should be selected in cases of renal dysfunction.</Para><Para id="_506">SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine and sertraline) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g., venlafaxine) are considered first-line pharmacotherapy for long-term management of anxiety disorders. SSRIs and SNRIs are also effective in the treatment of depressive symptoms frequently comorbid with persistent anxiety disorders. SSRIs and SNRIs can take approximately 4 to 6 weeks to take effect because of their slow onset of action. Benzodiazepines are frequently used as adjunctive agents to stabilize symptoms in the initial period of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs.</Para><Para id="_508">Atypical antidepressants (e.g., mirtazapine) are sometimes used to treat anxiety disorders because of their added effects on comorbid symptoms, such as insomnia. Older medications, such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine and clomipramine) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine), are also effective in treating anxiety disorders. The use of antidepressants in clinical practice is limited by  their unfavorable side effects, poorer tolerability, and higher risks of toxicity.<Reference refidx="34"/></Para><Para id="_509">For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739#_98" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Suicide Risk in Cancer Patients</SummaryRef> section in Depression.</Para><Para id="_484">Buspirone, a nonbenzodiazepine, is useful in patients who have not previously
been treated with a benzodiazepine and in those who may abuse benzodiazepines
(e.g., those with a history of illicit substance abuse or alcoholism). 
Buspirone is also useful in the geriatric population to augment fluoxetine for the treatment of anxiety and depression.  The beginning dose is
5 mg   3 times a day and can be increased to 15 mg  3 times a day. 
Buspirone can also be given twice a day.</Para><Para id="_485">The use of specific classes of medications is considered for managing treatment-refractory anxiety symptoms or in certain clinical situations. Low-dose neuroleptics (e.g.,
thioridazine, 10 mg  3 times a day, and risperidone, 1 mg twice a day) are used to treat severe anxiety
when an adequate dose of a benzodiazepine is ineffective or if the patient
might be expected to respond poorly to benzodiazepines (e.g., patients with
brain metastases).  Low-dose neuroleptics can also be used when benzodiazepines
are not helpful or when delirium, dementia, or
other complications are possible. Low-dose anticonvulsants (e.g., pregabalin, 200 mg per day) are sometimes used to treat severe treatment-resistant anxiety when other medications are ineffective or contraindicated  because of certain associated risks.<Reference refidx="34"/> Generally, the use of neuroleptics or anticonvulsants is considered only after adequate trials of several first-line agents (SSRIs, SNRIs, and benzodiazepines) because of  their significant side effects and potential for drug-drug interactions with these agents. Consultation with a psychiatric clinician is strongly recommended before  these medications are used, with direct involvement of a psychiatric clinician or the management of patients taking these medications.</Para><Para id="_526">The presence or absence of specific psychiatric or medical comorbidities is frequently a critical factor in the selection of pharmacological treatments. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with other medications are also important factors to consider. Examples of factors and clinical situations driving the selection of pharmacological treatments include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_533" Style="bullet"><ListItem>When depressive symptoms are comorbid with anxiety, treatment with SSRIs, SNRIs, or other antidepressants is strongly considered.</ListItem><ListItem>When neuropathic pain is comorbid with anxiety symptoms, specific antidepressants with known efficacy in treating neuropathic pain (e.g., duloxetine and venlafaxine) are considered.</ListItem><ListItem> When hot flashes are comorbid with anxiety symptoms, specific agents with known efficacy in treating hot flashes (e.g., venlafaxine) are considered.</ListItem><ListItem>Specific medications with known side effects (e.g., nausea with duloxetine or risk of sedation with mirtazapine) are avoided when patients are already experiencing these side effects from their cancer treatments and because of the possible exacerbation of these side effects. </ListItem><ListItem>Patients who are treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine) and tamoxifen may be at  risk of significant drug-drug interactions.

It is often assumed that children undergoing cancer treatment are at significantly higher risk for depression, anxiety, and other indicators of psychological distress. However, the empirical evidence to support this assumption is weak. Overall, studies suggest that children treated for cancer and children who are long-term survivors of cancer experience few significant psychological adjustment problems.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_819">There is evidence that children experience distress during cancer treatment. Distress appears to be most significant early in therapy, typically when frequent hospitalizations are necessary, with less distress occurring over time.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  One group of 39 families of children newly diagnosed with leukemia was compared with a group of 49 families of healthy children. While parents and the children treated for cancer reported higher levels of distress immediately after diagnosis, these levels of distress decreased over 4 years of follow-up, and there were no significant differences in psychological distress compared with the healthy comparison cohort.<Reference refidx="4"/> Similar findings have been reported across cultures.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_820">The validity of obtaining accurate reports of psychological distress in this population has been questioned. One investigation examined whether psychological defensiveness might mask the reporting of depression and other symptoms of psychological distress. Researchers studied 107 children treated for cancer and 422 healthy controls, who completed a series of measures of depression and anxiety.<Reference refidx="7"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Children treated for cancer reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than did healthy children, and defensive style was not related to reports of depression. Another study of 205 children and 321 parents of children with cancer, asthma, or no significant health problem also found no significant levels of depression in children treated for cancer. However, parents of children with cancer attributed more cheerful characteristics to their children than the parents of children in the other groups.<Reference refidx="8"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_821">Studies have reported no differences from controls on the following measures:</Para><ItemizedList id="_822" Style="bullet">

Using extensive survey methodology that links reports of current functioning to diagnosis, types of treatment, and other health factors associated with cancer and its treatment, the CCSS has selectively looked at long-term adjustment in large samples of young adults treated for similar childhood cancers. In one CCSS report, 2,778 survivors of solid tumors diagnosed in childhood and 2,925 siblings were surveyed using a standardized, long-term, follow-up questionnaire. Symptoms associated with depression, somatization, and anxiety were reported, along with demographic, health, and medical information. Cancer survivors reported few, if any, symptoms of psychological distress, although survivors of solid-tumor cancers reported higher levels of global distress than their siblings. There were no differences on these measures from population norms. For both cancer survivors and their siblings, female gender, lower education and income attainment, perceived poor health status, and reports of current health problems were all associated with higher levels of psychological distress symptoms.<Reference refidx="27"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_840">The CCSS also reported positive findings for young adults who are survivors of leukemias and lymphomas. Follow-up questionnaires about psychological adjustment were administered to 5,736 young adult survivors of leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma and to 2,565 adult siblings. Survivors reported higher levels of depressive symptoms and somatic distress than siblings, but  neither group's scores fell within the clinically significant range for the general population. Sociodemographic factors such as gender and socioeconomic status were associated with reports of depressive symptoms, regardless of treatment status. The only disease-related factor associated with psychological distress was intensive chemotherapy, which was linked to an increase in somatic complaints.<Reference refidx="2"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Similar outcomes were reported for survivors of brain cancers.
