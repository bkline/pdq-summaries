Although some clinical guidelines refer to lifetime risk cutoffs when assessing higher versus lower cancer risks, no model has been validated to predict  full lifetime risk, since that would require following cohorts for a lifetime.<Reference refidx="134"/>  Using a shorter time horizon  improved model performance, particularly for women under age 50 years, since many factors for risk models change over time.<Reference refidx="135"/> For example, data from a large family-based cohort  (n = 14,657 women; median follow-up of 10 years),  showed that the 5-year incidence for breast cancer almost always had a higher <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322884" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">specificity</GlossaryTermRef> (i.e.,  fewer false positives) than that of lifetime risk from birth. For women aged 20 to 39 years, 5-year risk performed better than lifetime risk from birth.

Most breast cancer risk models include established reproductive risk factors for breast cancer (e.g., age at menarche, parity, etc.).

A similar trend of identifying pathogenic variants in non-<GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> susceptibility genes in male breast cancer patients has also been described.<Reference refidx="245"/> In two studies of women who had previously tested negative for <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, reflex testing with a multigene panel identified pathogenic variants in additional genes among 8% to 11% of cases.<Reference refidx="246"/><Reference refidx="247"/> In a study of 77,085 patients with breast cancer and 6,001 patients with ovarian cancer, 24.1% and 30.9% had genetic testing, respectively.  Of those tested, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 7.8% of patients with breast cancer and 14.5% of patients with ovarian cancer. Prevalent non-<GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> pathogenic variants identified in patients with breast cancer included <GeneName>CHEK2</GeneName> (1.6%), <GeneName>PALB2</GeneName> (1.0%), <GeneName>ATM</GeneName> (0.7%), and <GeneName>NBN</GeneName> (0.4%). In patients with ovarian cancer, non-<GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> pathogenic variants included <GeneName>CHEK2</GeneName> (1.4%), <GeneName>BRIP1</GeneName> (0.9%), <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> (0.8%), and <GeneName>ATM</GeneName> (0.6%).<Reference refidx="248"/> The potential utility of genetic testing in patients with ovarian tumors of all histologies was suggested in a study using a 32-gene panel that found 13.2% of 4,439 tumors harbored a pathogenic variant. Rates were highest among those with serous ovarian carcinoma (14.7%), although likely pathogenic variants were also seen in those with other histologies (borderline, germ cell, and sex cord stromal tumors), the significance of which is unclear to clinical management or etiology of disease.<Reference refidx="249"/></Para><Para id="_3426">Multi-gene panel testing was conducted as part of two large efforts led by the worldwide Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) <Reference refidx="250"/>  and the United States–based CARRIERS consortium.<Reference refidx="251"/> The BCAC study tested 113,927 women  for 34 inherited cancer genes, while the CARRIERS study  tested 64,791 women for 28 hereditary cancer genes. In both studies, significant associations were reported between  eight genes and breast cancer development (<GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>, <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, <GeneName>PALB2</GeneName>, <GeneName>BARD1</GeneName>, <GeneName>RAD51C</GeneName>, <GeneName>RAD51D</GeneName>, <GeneName>ATM</GeneName>, and <GeneName>CHEK2</GeneName>). Associations were only reported between <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName> and breast cancer development in the BCAC study. Similarly, associations were only reported between  <GeneName>CDH1</GeneName> and breast cancer development  in the CARRIERS study. Both <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> and <GeneName>PTEN</GeneName> (which are established breast cancer risk genes that are linked to early-onset disease) were not significantly associated with breast cancer development in these studies. This is presumably because <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> and <GeneName>PTEN</GeneName> pathogenic variants are very rare.</Para><Para id="_3290">NCCN recommends that women  diagnosed with TNBC  undergo <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, <GeneName>CDH1</GeneName>, <GeneName>PALB2</GeneName>, <GeneName>PTEN</GeneName>, <GeneName>STK11</GeneName>, and <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> testing to guide treatment decisions at any age.<Reference refidx="209"/>  A large study utilizing multigene (panel) testing comprising two separate cohorts reported that, in addition to <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>  genes, six other breast cancer susceptibility genes were also related to a higher risk of TNBC.  Specifically, pathogenic variants in <GeneName>BARD1</GeneName>, <GeneName>PALB2</GeneName>, and <GeneName>RAD51D</GeneName>, in addition to <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, were each associated with more than a fivefold increase in breast cancer.<Reference refidx="252"/>  Pathogenic variants in three other genes —<GeneName>BRIP1</GeneName>, <GeneName>RAD51C</GeneName>, and <GeneName>TP53</GeneName>— were each associated with an increased TNBC risk of more than twofold.  Pathogenic variants in these eight genes were reported in 12% of the TNBC cases (8.3% <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, 3.7% non-<GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>).   The study was conducted in a clinical testing cohort of 140,449 individuals (8,753 TNBC cases) who received genetic testing using a 21-gene panel (sample A).  In addition, a second sample (sample B) examined gene frequency rates in a pooled consortium of 2,143 individuals using a 17-gene panel.  The overall frequency of pathogenic variants in the 21 genes examined in sample A was 14.4% (8.4% <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, 6.0% non-<GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>).  The two samples had very consistent findings with respect to the risk estimates despite differences in age, race, ethnicity, and family history of cancer with sample A being younger, more racially and ethnically diverse, and more likely to have a family history of cancer.   The pathogenic variant frequency detection in these 21 genes was also similar for White individuals (14% overall, 7.8% <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, 6.2% non-<GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>) and African American individuals (14.6% overall,  9.0% <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, 5.6% non-<GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>).</Para><Para id="_3428">Multi-gene panel testing studies were conducted in women from the United States who had African ancestry, and results showed that certain genes were associated with increased breast cancer risk in this population. These genes were similar to the breast cancer risk genes found in individuals from the United States with European ancestry. A case-control study of 10,047 women with African ancestry found a pathogenic variant frequency of 10.3% in those with ER-negative breast cancer, 5.2% in those with ER-positive breast cancer, and 2.3% in  those without breast cancer.  <GeneName>BRCA1 </GeneName>(OR, 47), <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> (OR, 7.25) and <GeneName>PALB2</GeneName> (OR, 8.54) were associated with the highest breast cancer risks.<Reference refidx="253"/> High ER-negative breast cancer risk was reported in individuals with pathogenic variants in <GeneName>RAD51D</GeneName> (OR, 7.82), while moderate ER-positive breast cancer risk was reported in individuals with pathogenic variants in <GeneName>CHEK2</GeneName>, <GeneName>ATM</GeneName>, <GeneName>ERCC3</GeneName>, and <GeneName>FANCC</GeneName>. Similarly, a case-control study of 3,286 women with African ancestry found significant associations between breast cancer risk and pathogenic variants in the following genes: <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>, <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, <GeneName>PALB2</GeneName>, <GeneName>ATM</GeneName>, <GeneName>CHEK2</GeneName>, <GeneName>TP53</GeneName>, <GeneName>NF1</GeneName>, <GeneName>RAD51C</GeneName>, and <GeneName>RAD51D</GeneName>.<Reference refidx="254"/></Para><Para id="_3171">There are caveats of multigene testing.

These are two important but different concepts.  Relative risk (RR) refers to an estimate of risk relative to another group (e.g., risk of an outcome like breast cancer for women who are exposed to a risk factor <Emphasis>relative</Emphasis> to the risk of breast cancer for women who are unexposed to the same risk factor). RR measures that are greater than 1 mean that the risk for those captured in the numerator (i.e., the exposed) is higher than the risk for those captured in the denominator (i.e., the unexposed).  RR measures that are less than 1 mean that the risk for those captured in the numerator (i.e., the exposed) is lower than the risk for those captured in the denominator (i.e., the unexposed).  Measures with similar relative interpretations include the odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio, and risk ratio.</Para><Para id="_2760">AR measures consider the number of people who have a particular outcome, the number of people in a population who could have the outcome, and person-time (the period of time during which an individual was at risk of having the outcome). AR measures also reflect the absolute burden of an outcome in a population.  Absolute measures include risks and rates and can be expressed over a specific time frame (e.g., 1 year, 5 years) or overall lifetime. Cumulative risk is a measure of risk that occurs over a defined time period.  For example, overall lifetime risk is a type of cumulative risk that is usually calculated on the basis of a given life expectancy (e.g., 80 or 90 years). Cumulative risk can also be presented over other time frames (e.g., up to age 50 years).</Para><Para id="_2761">Large RR measures do not mean that there will be large effects in the actual number of individuals at a population level because the disease outcome may be quite rare.  For example, the RR for smoking is much higher for lung cancer than for heart disease, but the absolute difference between smokers and nonsmokers is greater for heart disease, the more-common outcome, than for lung cancer, the more-rare outcome.</Para><Para id="_2762">Therefore, in evaluating the effect of exposures and biological markers on disease prevention across the continuum, it is important to recognize the differences between relative and absolute effects in weighing the overall impact of a given risk factor. For example, the magnitude is in the range of 30% (e.g., ORs or RRs of 1.3) for many breast cancer risk factors, which means that women with a risk factor (e.g., alcohol consumption, late age at first birth, oral contraceptive use, postmenopausal body size) have a 30% relative increase in breast cancer in comparison with what they would have if they did not have that risk factor.  But the absolute increase in risk is based on the underlying AR of disease.  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062855#_2922" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq">Figure 5</SummaryRef> and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062855#_2822" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq">Table 2</SummaryRef>  show the impact of a RR factor in the range of 1.3 on AR.

The candidate gene approach involves selecting genes based on their known or presumed biological function, relevance to carcinogenesis or organ physiology, and then searching for or testing known genetic variants for an association with cancer risk.

The addition of genetic information modestly changed the AUC from 58% to 61.8%, a result that was not felt to be clinically significant.

Attitudinal predictors of interest in PGT included agreement that others at risk of HBOC should be offered PGT; the belief that PGT is acceptable for individuals at risk of HBOC; the belief that PGT information should be given to individuals at risk of HBOC; and endorsement of PGT benefits of having children without genetic variants and eliminating genetic diseases. Conversely, those who indicated that PGT was “too much like playing God” and reported that they considered PGT in the context of religion, had less interest in PGT.</Para><Para id="_2821">It is unknown whether the attitudes of FORCE members toward PGT are representative of the majority of <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> carriers. A cross-sectional study of 1,081 <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> carriers, 65% of whom were recruited through FORCE and the remainder by the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that a majority of carriers were in favor of offering PGT and prenatal diagnosis to carriers (59% for PGT and 55.5% for prenatal diagnosis).<Reference refidx="190"/> Of those who indicated that their families were not complete, 41% of <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> carriers reported that their carrier status impacted their decision about future biological children.

the primary impact was related to accelerating the timing of pregnancy, feelings of guilt about possibly passing on the pathogenic variant to offspring, and having future children. In response to a 
hypothetical scenario in which PGT was readily available, 33% of participants reported that they would undergo PGT. Factors associated with this intention were having no future reproductive plans at the time of the survey, feeling pregnancy termination was an acceptable option in the context of identifying a <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> pathogenic variant, and having fewer cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer in the family. When presented with questions about expectations about delivery of PGT or prenatal diagnosis  information, 85% of respondents felt it should be provided along with <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> test results; 45% felt that it should be provided when carriers decide to have children.

that they would expect this information to be delivered by cancer geneticists (92%), obstetrician/gynecologists (76%), and general practitioners (48%).</Para><Para id="_2374">A small (N = 25) qualitative study of women of reproductive age positive for a <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> pathogenic variant who underwent genetic testing before having children evaluated how their <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> status influenced their attitudes about reproductive genetic testing (both PGT and prenatal diagnosis) and decisions about having children.<Reference refidx="194"/> In this study, the decision to undergo <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> testing was primarily motivated by the desire to manage one’s personal cancer risk, rather than a desire to inform future reproductive decisions. The perceived severity of HBOC influenced concerns about passing on a <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> pathogenic variant to children and also influenced willingness to consider PGT or prenatal diagnosis. Decisions about PGT and prenatal diagnosis also varied based on the participant's  personal experiences. Most did not believe that a known <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> pathogenic variant was a reason to terminate a pregnancy. As observed in prior studies, knowledge of reproductive options varied; however, there was a tendency among participants to view PGT as more acceptable than prenatal diagnosis with regard to termination of 
pregnancy. Decisions regarding the pros and cons of PGT versus prenatal diagnosis with termination of pregnancy were driven primarily by personal preferences and experiences, rather than by morality judgments. For example, women were deterred from PGT based on the need to undergo <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> fertilization and to take hormones that might increase cancer risk and based on the observed 
experiences of others who underwent this procedure.</Para><Para id="_2326">One study has examined these issues among high-risk men recruited from FORCE and Craigslist (a bulletin board website) (N = 228).<Reference refidx="195"/> Similar to the previous studies of women, only 20% of men were aware of PGT before survey participation. In a multivariate analysis, those who selected the “other” option for possible benefits of PGT compared with those who selected from several predetermined options (e.g., having children without genetic variants) and those who considered PGT in the context of 
religion (as opposed to health and safety) were less likely to report that they would ever consider using PGT.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_308"><Title>Cultural/Community Effects</Title><Para id="_309">The recognition that <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> pathogenic variants are prevalent, not only in

Additionally, carriers of <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> pathogenic variants and women with a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer had higher mean levels of cancer-related distress than women with a limited family history.<Reference refidx="239"/></Para><Para id="_793">Very little is known about how the results of genetic testing affect treatment decisions at the time of cancer diagnosis.  Two studies explored genetic counseling and <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> genetic testing at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="222"/>  One of these studies found that genetic testing at the time of diagnosis significantly altered surgical decision making, with more pathogenic variant carriers than noncarriers opting for bilateral mastectomy.  Bilateral RRM was chosen by 48% of women with a known pathogenic variant <Reference refidx="222"/> and by 100% of women with a known pathogenic variant in a smaller series <Reference refidx="24"/> of women undergoing testing at the time of diagnosis.  Of women in whom no pathogenic variant was found, 24% also opted for bilateral RRM. Four percent of the test decliners also underwent bilateral RRM. Among carriers of pathogenic variants, predictors of bilateral RRM included whether patients reported that their physicians had recommended <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> testing and bilateral RRM before testing, and whether they received a positive test result.<Reference refidx="222"/> Data are lacking on quality-of-life outcomes for women who undergo RRM after genetic testing that is performed at the time of diagnosis.</Para><Para id="_1408">A prospective study from the Netherlands evaluated long-term psychological outcomes of offering women with breast cancer genetic counseling and, if indicated, genetic testing at the onset of breast radiation for treatment of their primary breast cancer. Of those who were approached for counseling, some underwent genetic testing and chose to receive their result (n = 58), some were approached but did not fulfill referral criteria (n = 118), and some declined the option of counseling/testing (n = 44). Another subset of women undergoing radiation therapy was not approached for counseling (n = 182) but  was followed using the same measures. Psychological distress was measured at baseline and at 4, 11, 27, and 43 weeks after initial consultation for radiation therapy. No differences were detected in general anxiety, depression or breast cancer–specific distress across all four groups.<Reference refidx="240"/></Para><Para id="_1020">A retrospective questionnaire study of 583 women with a personal and family history of breast cancer and who underwent contralateral RRM between 1960 and 1993 measured overall satisfaction after mastectomy and factors influencing satisfaction and dissatisfaction with this procedure.<Reference refidx="241"/> The mean time of follow-up was 10.3 years after risk-reducing surgery. Overall, 83% of all participants stated they were satisfied or very satisfied, 8% were neutral, and 9% were dissatisfied with contralateral RRM. Most women also reported favorable effects or no change in their self-esteem, level of stress, and emotional stability after surgery (88%, 83%, and 88%, respectively). Despite the high levels of overall satisfaction, 33% reported negative body image, 26% reported a reduced sense of femininity, and 23% reported a negative effect on sexual relationships. The type of surgical procedure also affected levels of satisfaction. The authors attributed this difference to the high rate of unanticipated reoperations in the group of women having subcutaneous mastectomy (43%) versus the group having simple mastectomy (15%) (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001). Limitations to this study are mostly related to the time period during which participants had their surgery (i.e., availability of surgical reconstructive option).<Reference refidx="241"/><Reference refidx="242"/> None of these women had genetic testing for pathogenic variants in the <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> genes. Nevertheless, this study shows that while most women in this group were satisfied with contralateral RRM, all women reported at least one adverse outcome. </Para><Para id="_3027">A retrospective survey of 137 <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> carriers examined the psychosocial impact of preserving the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) in women with bilateral RRM.<Reference refidx="243"/> The study found that body image and sexual well-being differed significantly based on the type of RRM the women underwent. Women with NAC preservation were more satisfied with their breasts (72% vs. 61%), were more satisfied with the surgical outcome (85% vs. 74%) and had greater sexual well-being (68% vs. 52%) than women without NAC preservation. No differences in cancer-related distress, anxiety, depression, or risk perceptions were observed between the two groups. Oncological outcomes of nipple-sparing mastectomy in <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> carriers have not been inferior to RRM without NAC preservation.<Reference refidx="244"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000811356#_3632" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq">Risk-reducing strategies for breast cancer</SummaryRef> section in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>: Cancer Risks and Management for more information.)</Para><Para id="_1225">Another study compared long-term quality-of-life outcomes in 195 women after bilateral RRM performed between 1979 and 1999 versus 117 women at high risk of breast cancer opting for screening.  No statistically significant differences were detected between the groups for psychosocial outcomes. Eighty-four percent of those opting for surgery reported satisfaction with their decision.  Sixty-one percent of women from both the surgery and screening groups reported being very much or quite a bit contented with their quality of life.<Reference refidx="245"/></Para><Para id="_1398">In a study of psychosocial outcomes associated with RRM and immediate reconstruction,  61 high-risk women (27 carriers of pathogenic variants, others with high-risk family history), 31 of whom had a prior history of breast cancer, were evaluated on average 3 to 4 years after surgery.<Reference refidx="246"/> The study utilized questions designed to elicit yes versus no responses and found that the surgery was well-tolerated with 83% of 
participants reporting that the results of their reconstructive surgery were as they expected, 90% reporting that they had received adequate preoperative information, none reporting that they regretted the surgery, and all reporting that 
they would choose the same 
route if they had to do it again. Satisfaction with the results ranged from 74% satisfied with the shape of their breasts to 89% satisfied with the appearance of the scarring. Comparison of this group to normative samples on quality-of-life indicators (Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire scores) indicated no reductions in quality of life in these women.</Para><Para id="_1399">A qualitative study examining material on the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.facingourrisk.org/index.php">FORCE</ExternalRef> website posted by 21 high-risk women (<GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName>-positive) undergoing RRM showed that these women anticipated and received negative reactions from friends and family regarding the surgery, and that they managed disclosure in ways to maintain emotional support and self-protection for their decision. Many of the women expressed a relief from intrusive breast cancer thoughts and worry, and were satisfied with the cosmetic result of their surgery.<Reference refidx="247"/></Para><Para id="_1400">In contrast, another study examined long-term psychosocial outcomes in 684 women who had had bilateral or contralateral RRM on average 9 years before assessment.<Reference refidx="248"/> A majority of women (59%) also had reconstructive surgery.  Interestingly, based on a Likert scale, 85% of women reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with their decision to have an RRM. However, in qualitative interviews, many women went on to describe dissatisfaction or negative psychosocial outcomes associated with surgery. The authors coded the responses as negative when women reported still being anxious about their breast cancer risk and/or reported negative feelings about their body image, pain, and sexuality. Seventy-nine percent of the women providing negative comments and 84% of those making mixed comments (mixture of satisfaction and dissatisfaction) responded that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with their decision. Twice as many women with bilateral mastectomy made negative and mixed comments than did women with contralateral mastectomy. The areas of most concern were body image, problems with breast implants, pain after surgery, and sexuality. The authors proposed that those who had undergone contralateral procedures had already been treated for cancer, while those who had undergone bilateral procedures had not been treated previously, and this may partially account for the differences in satisfaction between the two groups. These findings suggest that women's satisfaction with RRM may be tempered by their complex reactions over time. </Para><Para id="_1592">In a qualitative study of 108 women who underwent or were considering RRM, more than half of those <Emphasis>who had RRM</Emphasis> felt that presurgical consultation with a psychologist was advisable; nearly two-thirds thought that postsurgical consultation was also appropriate.

Even the  presence of known pathogenic variants in their families was not associated with good adherence to recommended screening practices.  Sixty-nine percent of women aged 50 to 64 years and 83% of women aged 40 to 49 years had had a screening mammogram in the previous year.  Twenty percent of participants had ever had a CA-125 test and 31% had ever had a pelvic ultrasound or TVUS. Further analysis of this study population <Reference refidx="253"/> looking specifically at 107 women with informative <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> test results found good use of breast cancer screening, though the uptake rate in younger carriers is lower. The reason for the lower uptake rate was not explored in this study.<Reference refidx="254"/> One survey of screening behaviors among women at increased risk of breast/ovarian cancer identified physician recommendations as a significant factor in adherence to screening.<Reference refidx="255"/> </Para><Para id="_1021">While motivations cited for pursuing genetic testing often include the expectation that carriers of pathogenic variants will be more compliant with breast and/or ovarian screening recommendations,<Reference refidx="253"/><Reference refidx="256"/><Reference refidx="257"/><Reference refidx="258"/> limited data exist about whether participants in genetic testing alter their screening behaviors over time and about other variables that may influence those behaviors, such as insurance coverage and physician recommendations or attitudes.
The impact of cancer genetic counseling on screening behaviors was assessed in a U.K. study of 293 women followed for 12 months postcounseling at  four cancer genetics clinics.<Reference refidx="259"/> BSE, CBE, and mammography were significantly increased after counseling; however, gaps in adherence to recommendations were noted: 38% of women aged 35 to 49 years had not had a mammogram by 12 months postcounseling. BSE was not done by most women at the recommended time and frequency. </Para><Para id="_334">This is a critical issue not only for women testing positive, but also for
adherence to screening for those testing negative and those who have
received <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556497" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">indeterminate results</GlossaryTermRef> or choose not to receive their results.  It is
possible that adherence actually diminishes with a decrease in the perceived
risk that may result from a negative genetic test result.
</Para><Para id="_335">In addition, while there is still some question regarding the link between
cancer-related worry and breast cancer screening behavior, accumulating
evidence appears to support a linear rather than a curvilinear relationship. 
That is, for some time, the data were not consistent; some data supported the
hypothesis that mild-to-moderate worry may increase adherence, while excessive
worry may actually decrease the utilization of recommended screening practices. 
Other reports support the notion that a linear relationship is more likely;
that is, more worry increases adherence to screening recommendations.  Few
studies, however,  have followed women to assess their health behaviors
after genetic testing.  Thus, a negative test result leading to decreased
worry could theoretically result in decreased screening adherence.  A large study found that patient compliance with screening practices was not related to general or screening-specific anxiety—with the exception of BSE, for which compliance is negatively associated with procedure-specific anxiety.<Reference refidx="77"/> Further
research designed to clarify this potential concern would highlight the need
for comprehensive genetic counseling to discuss the need for follow-up
screening.  
 </Para><Para id="_336">Further complicating this area of research are issues such as the baseline rate
of mammography adherence among women older than 40 or 50 years before genetic
testing.  More specifically, the ability to note a significant difference in
adherence on this measure may be affected by the high adherence rate to this
screening behavior before genetic testing by women undergoing such testing.   It
may be easier to find significant changes in mammography use among women with a
family history of breast cancer who test positive.  Finally, adherence over
time will likely be affected by how women undergoing genetic
testing and their caregivers perceive the efficacy of many of the screening options
in question, such as mammography for younger women, BSE,
and ovarian cancer screening (periodic vaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125
measurements), along with the value of preventive interventions.</Para><Para id="_337">The issue of screening decision-making and adherence among women undergoing
genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer is the subject of several ongoing
trials, and an area of much needed ongoing study. </Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="16702359">Ropka ME, Wenzel J, Phillips EK, et al.: Uptake rates for breast cancer genetic testing: a systematic review.
