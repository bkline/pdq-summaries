Entelev and provided it free of charge to patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044178" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">terminal</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  In 1984, production was taken over by a second manufacturer who
distributed the mixture free of charge under the trademarked name Cancell to
individuals with cancer, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045950" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">AIDS</GlossaryTermRef>, and other conditions.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_12">The two principal manufacturers of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel have offered somewhat
different explanations for cancer development, but their theories about how
the mixture works are quite similar.  According to the original manufacturer, human <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cells</GlossaryTermRef> can be normal, cancerous, or primitive.<Reference refidx="1"/>   Each of these
cellular forms is distinguished by the degree of oxygen utilization in 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044126" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cellular metabolism</GlossaryTermRef>.  Normal
cells use <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043992" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">aerobic metabolism</GlossaryTermRef> 
(<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044131" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">glycolysis</GlossaryTermRef> plus additional 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044124" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">biochemical reactions</GlossaryTermRef> that
require oxygen) to produce the energy needed for growth and maintenance. 
Primitive cells only use  glycolysis, which is a much less
efficient way to produce energy.  It was proposed that normal cells become
cancerous when, in response to certain damaging conditions such as chronic
energy stress (a demand for energy greater than the cell’s ability to produce
it), they reach a critical point and begin to rely mainly on glycolysis to
produce energy.  According to this theory, cancerous cells still maintain many
of the features of normal cells and cannot be recognized by the body as
foreign.  According to the original manufacturer, Cancell/Cantron/Protocel causes
cancer cells to become completely primitive, i.e., their residual aerobic
metabolism is inhibited and they produce energy solely by glycolysis.  The
resulting primitive cells are then seen by the body as foreign and
destroyed.  While the aerobic metabolism of normal cells is also inhibited
by Cancell/Cantron/Protocel, they are too far removed from the critical point to become
cancerous or completely primitive.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_13">The second manufacturer suggested that a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044123" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">bacterium</GlossaryTermRef> called <ScientificName>Progenitor cryptocides</ScientificName> is
involved in cancer development.<Reference refidx="1"/>  According to this theory, <ScientificName>P. 
cryptocides</ScientificName> becomes activated in individuals whose bodies are damaged by an
improper <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">diet</GlossaryTermRef>.  Once activated, this bacterium helps cause damaged normal
cells to shift their energy production from aerobic metabolism to glycolysis. 
When the demand for energy exceeds the damaged normal cell’s ability to
produce it, the cell <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044133" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">mutates</GlossaryTermRef> and becomes
cancerous.  Once again, Cancell/Cantron/Protocel forces cancerous cells into a
completely primitive state where they self-digest and are replaced by
normal cells.  The waste material produced by this self-digestion process is
discarded by the body in a variety of ways: in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046642" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">urine</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046605" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">stool</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044308" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">vaginal</GlossaryTermRef>
discharge, or perspiration; it may also be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390324" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">vomited</GlossaryTermRef> or coughed up.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_14">The idea that cancer cells show increased levels of glycolysis
compared with normal cells is widely accepted, but this change in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046173" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">metabolism</GlossaryTermRef> is not believed to be a
fundamental cause of cancer development.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  In addition, there
is no scientific evidence that Cancell/Cantron/Protocel or any of its components can
cause cells to produce energy solely by glycolysis or is able to treat cancer
effectively.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  Furthermore, there is no evidence to
support the existence of the bacterium <ScientificName>P. cryptocides</ScientificName>.<Reference refidx="7"/> </Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8422607" MedlineID="93137113">Questionable methods of cancer management: Cancell/Entelev.

     </Table><Para id="_1014">Based on the manufacturer's recommended <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">doses</GlossaryTermRef> of a marketed brand of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel it has been calculated that under idealized conditions of absolutely no loss of the constituents after <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478733" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">administration</GlossaryTermRef> to a patient (i.e., 100% <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044225" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">bioavailability</GlossaryTermRef>, meaning no loss due to degradation, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463702" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">absorption</GlossaryTermRef> in the body, or rapid excretion—an unlikely situation), the maximum concentration that could be achieved in the plasma of an average 154-lb male is 29 μg/mL (antilog of 1.46). Thus, under these highly idealized conditions Cancell/Cantron/Protocel may exhibit some mild inhibitory effect on the growth of some cancer cells, but it would not be expected to inhibit their growth completely or to kill them. There is  little evidence that any of the constituents of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel would be available in the bloodstream of a patient. </Para><Para id="_1015">Activity was seen in  two-thirds of the cell lines,  though at levels that would be roughly 275 times higher than the theoretical maximum concentration achievable in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044088" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">serum</GlossaryTermRef>. Therefore, the <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> effects are likely due to nonspecific effects of changes in salt concentration.  Furthermore,  cells in the NCI Tumor Cell Line Screen are grown in artificial media under conditions that do not truly mimic the <Emphasis>in vivo</Emphasis> situation in animals or humans, and results obtained with the screen  may not accurately reflect possible effects in humans.
