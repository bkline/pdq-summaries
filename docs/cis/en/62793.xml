When the incidence of PTSD-like symptoms (not meeting the full DSM diagnostic criteria) is measured, rates are higher, ranging from 20% in patients with early-stage cancer to 80% in those with recurrent cancer.</Para><Para id="_107">The earliest research on PTS among cancer survivors concentrated on the prevalence and characteristics of the disorder in patients
who had undergone or were undergoing treatment,  adult and child cancer survivors, and/or  their 
family members.  A wide variety of cancer types
 was studied, including leukemia,<Reference refidx="2"/> breast cancer,
and head and neck cancers.<Reference refidx="3"/> Much of this early research, which predates DSM-IV, dealt  with survivors of Hodgkin disease, probably because diagnoses at an early age and higher rates of survival resulted in  a larger population available for study.<Reference refidx="4"/>   These survivors had a particularly high prevalence of intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors, even though they were many years posttreatment.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>  Most of these studies    investigated PTSD-like symptoms, rather than the complete mental disorder  with all diagnostic criteria.</Para><Para id="_108"> The first study of cancer patients  using the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria  looked at  27 patients (most with breast cancer), all at least 3 years postdiagnosis and no longer receiving any cancer treatments.  Prevalence rates of 4% for current PTSD and 22% for lifetime prevalence were found.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Those who met the criteria for lifetime prevalence were
noted to have higher levels of general psychological distress, suggesting that
individuals with a history of PTSD are at a substantial risk of continued
emotional difficulties.</Para><Para id="_109">Studies using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) <Reference refidx="9"/>  found prevalence rates for PTSD between 3% and 10% in adult patients with cancer. Most of these studies looked at  women with early-stage breast cancer, who were evaluated a few months to a few years after their cancer treatments.  Similarly, in a prospective study of 115  patients with all stages of breast cancer being treated at a comprehensive cancer center,  4% met the full diagnostic criteria for PTSD; 41% met the subsyndromal criteria for PTSD  (experiencing intense fear, helplessness, or horror after being diagnosed with cancer).  This set of subsyndromal criteria was a weak predictor of PTSD (12%) but a useful predictor of major depressive disorder,  global anxiety disorder, and past major depressive disorder, and it may better serve as a marker for elevated distress.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_215">In a few studies of patients who underwent bone marrow transplants, slightly higher prevalence rates of PTSD have been reported, ranging from 5% <Reference refidx="11"/> to 12% to 19% <Reference refidx="12"/>  to as high as 35%.<Reference refidx="13"/>    The range appears to be  influenced by time of assessment (higher rates occur with more  time since transplant) and the assessment method used.  Studies reporting lower rates typically used a self-report questionnaire,<Reference refidx="14"/>  whereas those reporting higher rates <Reference refidx="13"/> used the SCID and evaluated for symptoms at multiple time points since diagnosis (i.e.,  lifetime prevalence). The changes to the fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5)  included removal of  the subjective response of “intense fear, horror, or helplessness” that had been added to Criterion A in the DSM-IV.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_125">To illustrate the distinction between these tools, a German study  evaluated patients with breast cancer (n = 127) for PTSD immediately postsurgery and 6 months after the first assessment.<Reference refidx="16"/>  The assessments included screening instruments  for acute stress disorder (ASD) and PTSD, such as the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and  the PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C). The first assessment also included a semistructured interview using the SCID.  Based on the SCID, 2.4% of participants met the criteria for mild-to-moderate cancer-related PTSD, and 2.4% were diagnosed with ASD.  However, the IES-R and PCL-C screening instruments identified PTSD in 18.5% of participants at the first assessment and in 11.2% to 16.3% of participants at the second assessment.  Authors of the study suggested that unlike the SCID, the IES-R and PCL-C screening instruments measured diffuse  emotional distress and adjustment problems and not precise PTSD symptoms.</Para><Para id="_216">One of the main differences between symptom-based measures such as the PCL-C and an actual SCID-based diagnosis  is the dysfunction caused by the symptoms.  The symptoms are rather common, but only a small percentage of people who have the symptoms are disabled by them.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="12189252">Gurevich M, Devins GM, Rodin GM: Stress response syndromes and cancer: conceptual and assessment issues.

distressing event; however, this factor alone is not sufficient to explain the
disorder.  Not everyone exposed to a traumatic stressor develops the full-blown
syndrome (or subsets of symptoms) or qualifies for the diagnosis.  Attempts to
explain these differences and to predict who is vulnerable have focused on
the following types of factors:</Para><ItemizedList id="_234" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Psychological (i.e., learning theory).</ListItem><ListItem>Biological (especially hormonal).</ListItem><ListItem>Social
(i.e., social support).  </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_235">Early studies of Vietnam War veterans
suggested a two-factor learning theory to account for  trauma-related
pathology.<Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/>  The same theory has also  been applied to 
the development of PTSD in patients with cancer.<Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/></Para><Para id="_185">PTSD symptoms develop as a function
of both classical conditioning and instrumental learning.  Classical conditioning accounts
for the fear responses elicited by various stimuli that are 
associated with the original traumatic event.  Neutral stimuli (e.g., smells, sounds,
and visual images) previously paired with the aversive stimuli (e.g.,
chemotherapy or painful procedures) eventually evoke anxiety, arousal, and fear
when presented alone, even after the trauma has ended.  Higher-order
conditioning and stimulus generalization account for the exacerbation and
extension of symptoms to additional stimuli.  Once established, PTSD symptoms
are maintained through instrumental learning, that is, avoidant responses are
reinforced because avoidance of the stimuli prevents unpleasant feelings and
thoughts.</Para><Para id="_186">Estimates from epidemiological studies suggest that on average, 
25% to  33% of individuals who are exposed to traumatic events, including cancer,
develop PTSD or subsyndromal PTSD.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="41"/>  Although the disorder appears to be a result of learning
processes, many factors have been suggested to explain why one person 
develops PTSD and another does not.

Changes from the  fourth edition to the DSM-5 included the following:<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_210" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Elimination of the subjective component to the definition of trauma.</ListItem><ListItem> Tightening of the definitions of trauma and exposure to it.</ListItem><ListItem>Expansion and rearrangement of symptom criteria.</ListItem><ListItem>Changes in additional criteria and specifiers.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_189">Criterion A, which is necessary for PTSD and ASD diagnoses, specifically states, “A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve sudden, catastrophic events.” Thus, for the experience of cancer to meet Criterion A, it must entail acute and extreme adverse events in the context of cancer and/or cancer treatments. Events such as the cancer diagnosis, side effects of cancer treatments, and distress, worries, or negative thoughts about prognosis do not automatically qualify as trauma. Furthermore, patients with cancer can only be diagnosed with ASD or PTSD if they experience specific trauma-related symptoms, many of which are focused on or related to re-experiencing symptoms and intrusive memories. Fear of recurrence or worries about prognosis do not qualify as PTSD or ASD symptoms.</Para><Para id="_211">The four core clusters of symptoms for a PTSD diagnosis are as follows:</Para><ItemizedList id="_212" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Re-experiencing of trauma symptoms, e.g., nightmares, flashbacks, and intrusive memories (at least one out of five).</ListItem><ListItem>Avoidance symptoms, e.g., avoidance of distressing cancer memories (at least one out of two).</ListItem><ListItem>Numbing/dissociative and/or negative cognitive symptoms, e.g., unrealistic guilt or self-blame (at least two out of seven).</ListItem><ListItem>Arousal and reactivity symptoms, e.g., reckless/destructive behaviors and unprovoked angry outbursts (at least two out of six).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_213">These symptoms must last for at least 1 month and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_193"><Title>Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) and PTSD in the Cancer Setting</Title><Para id="_194">A timely, careful assessment of patients with cancer is critical to identify symptoms of cancer-related PTS, to note the deleterious
impact of the symptoms on functioning, and to plan interventions targeted at the most
distressing symptoms.
It is also critical  that the assessment distinguish between the full DSM PTSD syndrome (meets all required diagnostic criteria) and PTS-related symptoms only.</Para><Para id="_195">The most difficult aspect of PTS assessment in the cancer setting is the
determination of precisely when to evaluate the patient.  Diagnosis is complicated because
cancer is not an acute or discrete event, but an experience marked by repeated
trauma and indeterminate length.  An individual may exhibit the symptoms
of PTS at any point from diagnosis through treatment, to treatment completion
and, possibly, to recurrence.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Patients such as Holocaust survivors, whose history of victimization
can cause PTSD or its symptoms,  can have symptoms activated by any number of stimuli
encountered during their treatment (e.g., clinical procedures such as being
inside magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scanners).  While 
such patients may have more difficulty adjusting to cancer and cancer
treatment, their  symptomatology is likely to vary greatly according to their circumstances.  The relative predominance of specific PTS symptoms
may wax and wane throughout the cancer experience and beyond.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_196">The definition in the DSM-5 indicates that although PTSD symptoms usually begin within 3 months after trauma, there may be a delay of 4 or more months or even years
before symptoms appear.<Reference refidx="1"/>  These findings support the necessity for long-term monitoring of cancer survivors  and their family members.</Para><Para id="_197">At least one study found that individuals who have experienced a traumatic
event may exhibit early symptoms without meeting the full criteria for a
diagnosis of PTSD.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Nonetheless, the appearance of these early symptoms was
found to predict later development of full PTSD syndrome.  These results lend
further credence to the need for both repeated and long-term follow-up of
individuals exposed to the trauma of cancer.
For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062891" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq">Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_198">The difficulty of  properly diagnosing  PTS may be compounded by the
overlapping of PTS symptoms with those of other psychiatric disorders and by
the time-related aspects of normal adjustment.  For example, irritability, poor
concentration, hypervigilance, excessive fear, and disturbed sleep are also
symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.  Other arousal and avoidance symptoms
are common to PTSD, phobias, and panic disorder, but loss of interest, sense of
a foreshortened future, avoidance of other people, and sleep impairment might
suggest both PTSD and depressive disorders.  Even normal reactions to the
diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening disease can consist of responses
such as:</Para><ItemizedList id="_199" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem> Intrusive thoughts.</ListItem><ListItem>Disassociation  and depersonalization.</ListItem><ListItem>Sleep
disturbances.</ListItem><ListItem>Heightened arousal.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_200">Clinicians and researchers
must be particularly attuned to the causes, duration, and severity of PTSD-like
symptoms when considering PTSD among several diagnoses.
 For instance, in a study of women with breast cancer, 41% reported experiencing “intense fear, helplessness, or horror”; however, on further comprehensive diagnostic interview, only 4% met the full PTSD criteria.  Assessment must be able to distinguish between general psychological distress and symptoms of PTSD.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_201">The accurate diagnosis of PTSD also requires the use of reliable and valid
instruments.  Many studies have used the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R–Nonpatient Edition.<Reference refidx="6"/>     This instrument is a clinician-administered, structured clinical interview that is time intensive and may not be feasible in settings without adequately trained mental health professionals.   However, one study <Reference refidx="7"/>  investigated the utility of a cost-effective screening tool, the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C).<Reference refidx="8"/>   In this study of 82 women diagnosed with breast cancer assessed 6 to 72 months after cancer treatment, use of the PCL-C resulted in a sensitivity of 0.60 and specificity of 0.99.  Other cutoff scores for the PCL-C that could be used were discussed, depending on the clinical resources available in specific cancer treatment settings.  
Most research studies have used the Impact of Event Scale, a self-report  of intrusive thoughts;<Reference refidx="9"/>  however,  it is important to note that this tool can help evaluate PTS symptoms but is not designed to assess PTSD.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_155"><Title>Comorbidity</Title><Para id="_156">In attempting to diagnose PTSD, it is important to be aware that this disorder
is often marked by comorbid psychopathology.  Substance abuse, affective
disorders, and other anxiety disorders are consistently encountered in samples
of people with PTSD.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  For example, in one study, war veterans with PTSD
exhibited substantial comorbid pathology that included:<Reference refidx="13"/> </Para><ItemizedList id="_236" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Major depression (32% to 72%).</ListItem><ListItem> Alcohol dependence (65%).</ListItem><ListItem>Drug dependence (40%).</ListItem><ListItem> Social phobia (50%).</ListItem><ListItem>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (10%).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_237">  High rates of concurrent disorders
have also been documented in other trauma victims.  For example, 40% to 42% of
disaster survivors with PTSD also qualified for a diagnosis of major depression,
and 20% to 42% met the criteria for concurrent generalized anxiety
disorder.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/>  While co-occurring psychiatric disorders have not yet been studied in cancer patients or
survivors, their presence in Vietnam
War veterans and other trauma victims would indicate that cancer clinicians
should be alert  to identify and treat such related syndromes in
their patients.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_157"><Title>The Conceptual Fit of PTS and Cancer</Title><Para id="_158">Conceptual and practical problems can arise in the application of PTS to cancer patients and survivors. The basic concept of an extreme traumatic stressor has been described variously as an event involving direct personal experience that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury.<Reference refidx="15"/> This event can be protracted and continuous but is more frequently a single, time-limited event (e.g., rape, natural disaster).   In this context, for the person who has been diagnosed with cancer, the exact nature of the trauma is   unclear.   Is it the actual diagnosis,  aspects of the treatment process,  information given about recurrence, test results, or  some other aspect of the cancer experience? Identifying a discrete stressor within the multiple crises that constitute a cancer experience is more difficult  than for other traumas.  In one study of patients with breast cancer who underwent autologous bone marrow transplant,   more PTSD-like symptoms were reported at the time of initial diagnosis.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_159">Another concern regarding conceptual fit is related to re-experiencing  the trauma.  In a study of women with early-stage breast cancer, researchers found that the traumatizing aspects of the cancer experience were receiving the diagnosis and waiting for test results from node dissection.<Reference refidx="17"/>  Arguing that these “information traumas” tend to cause intrusive worry about the future—not intrusive recollections of past events—the authors  questioned whether cancer fits a conceptual model of  PTSD trauma.   Re-experiencing  the trauma is often measured in terms of unwanted intrusive thoughts about the traumatic event.  The cognitive processing of a current and ongoing health threat with uncertain outcome might  differ significantly from  unwanted intrusive thoughts about a single past event.  Some researchers have argued that not all intrusive thoughts are negative or indicate re-experiencing a trauma; rather, they might represent appropriate vigilance and attention to potential symptoms that could result in appropriate help-seeking.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_160">Conversely,  a unique study assessing the physiological reactivity of patients with breast cancer to a personalized imagery script of their most stressful experiences with cancer found elevated physiological responses that were comparable to those of PTSD patients who had experienced other (non–cancer-related) traumas.  This finding suggests a good fit between  patients with cancer and the PTSD trauma model, as it shows comparable  symptoms of increased arousal in patients with cancer.  Also, in a factor analytic study  designed to confirm the presence of the three broad PTSD symptom clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance of reminders, and hyperarousal), researchers found some tentative support for the DSM-IV symptom clusters in a sample of breast cancer survivors.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_161">In a study of 74 women breast cancer survivors interviewed at 18 months postdiagnosis via the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, three groups were identified:  one met the full criteria for PTSD (n = 12), another met partial criteria for PTSD (i.e., subsyndromal, n = 15), and a third group had no PTSD (n = 47).  Further analyses investigated group differences.  Some notable factors affecting  the full-criteria PTSD group compared with the subsyndromal and no-PTSD groups included the following:<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_162" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Significantly higher number of violent traumas (e.g., physical abuse, rape).</ListItem><ListItem>Higher number of anxiety disorders preceding a cancer diagnosis.</ListItem><ListItem>More advanced disease (75% stage III vs. 7% in the subsyndromal group and 6% in  the no-PTSD group).</ListItem><ListItem>More extensive surgeries (83% modified radical mastectomy vs. 47% in the subsyndromal group and 38% in the no-PTSD group).</ListItem><ListItem>Higher lifetime prevalence of previous PTSD (42% vs. 7% in the subsyndromal  group and 9% in the no-PTSD group).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_163">Further research is needed to continue to investigate the important question of how well the conceptual model of  PTSD as an anxiety response to a major life trauma fits the life experience of patients with cancer.   Reviews have argued both in favor of <Reference refidx="21"/>   and against <Reference refidx="18"/> the continued use of trauma models for conceptualizing the experience of cancer.  Others have proposed alternate conceptual models.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="22"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5. 5th ed.

Based on of this exposure model, a number of studies have examined whether children treated for cancer are at a significantly higher risk for developing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with mixed results.<Reference refidx="1"/> One study reported that children and adolescents who were undergoing treatment reported some symptoms of post-traumatic stress (PTS). However, for most children, these symptoms did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, and the symptoms diminished over time.<Reference refidx="2"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_243">Other studies suggest that survivors of childhood cancer have an increased risk for PTS  symptoms and PTSD after treatment is finished. In a study of 78 adults aged 18 to 41 years who had been treated for childhood cancer, 20.5% met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD at some time since the end of their treatment. Clinically significant events of intrusive symptoms (9%) and avoidant symptoms (16.7%) were reported in the sample, and the symptoms were associated with reports of elevated anxiety and other measures of psychological distress.<Reference refidx="3"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Survivors who report higher levels of uncertainty about their disease and the future appear more likely to have reports of elevated PTS symptoms.<Reference refidx="4"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_246">Similarly, a study of 182 adolescent and young adult cancer survivors who were more than 5 years from diagnosis and more than 2 years from completion of cancer treatment found that 16% met the criteria for PTSD.
