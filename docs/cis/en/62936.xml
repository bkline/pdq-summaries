With the advent of comprehensive genomic profiling and positron emission tomography–computed tomography scanning, less than 1% of new cancer diagnoses are designated as CUP.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_141">Most CUPs are adenocarcinomas or undifferentiated tumors. Less commonly,
squamous cell carcinomas, melanomas, sarcomas, germ cell tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors present with an undetermined primary site of origin.<Reference refidx="6"/> In some patients, the primary site cannot be identified even at postmortem examination.</Para><SummarySection id="_117"><Title>Prognosis and Survival</Title><Para id="_4">The prognosis for patients with CUP is poor. Approximately 30% of patients are alive at 1 year.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="7"/>  CUP is represented by a
heterogeneous group of diseases, all of which have presented with metastasis as
the primary manifestation.  Although most diseases are relatively
refractory to cytotoxic treatments, molecular and genetic diagnostics can identify targeted therapies that may result in a much better prognosis.<Reference refidx="1"/>  In each instance, the clinician must consider distinct
clinical and pathological details when selecting appropriate, and
potentially curative, management.</Para><Para id="_147">Survival is worse for patients with any of the following characteristics: <Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> </Para><ItemizedList id="_240" Style="bullet">

The pattern of spread of CUP at diagnosis can provide clues to the likelihood
of the primary site being above or below the diaphragm.  Lung metastases are
twice as common in primary sites ultimately found to be above the diaphragm. 
Liver metastases are more common from primary disease sites below the diaphragm.  A cancer presenting as CUP may have a significantly different pattern of metastasis than what is typically expected. For instance, when presenting as CUP, bone metastases are more common from pancreatic cancer and less common from lung cancer, unlike their typical presentation. 

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_225"><Title>Diagnostic Evaluation</Title><Para id="_226">The pathologist has a central role in the evaluation of CUP.  A thorough evaluation of an adequate specimen using
histology, immunohistochemistry, molecular diagnostics, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and, when appropriate, electron microscopy provides the most important clues in the diagnosis of CUP.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/> <Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>   Pathological evaluations provide guidance for an appropriate clinical
evaluation.</Para><Para id="_227">The following tests may be used to diagnose CUP:</Para><ItemizedList id="_228" Style="bullet">

Beta-hCG and AFP are not absolutely specific for germ cell tumors, and AFP is not specific for hepatoma.
