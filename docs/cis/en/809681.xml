When given this way, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas.  <Para id="_68">Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) is a type of regional chemotherapy used to treat childhood  hepatocellular carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery. The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). The drug is mixed with a substance that blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor, and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery. The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine to the liver. This procedure is also called transarterial chemoembolization, or TACE.</Para></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_118">Chemotherapy drugs used alone or in combination to treat childhood hepatocellular carcinoma include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_157" Style="bullet"><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000533338" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/cisplatin">cisplatin</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000542867" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/doxorubicinhydrochloride">doxorubicin</DrugRef></ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000537894" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/fluorouracil">fluorouracil</DrugRef> (5-FU)</ListItem><ListItem><DrugRef href="CDR0000599877" url="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/vincristinesulfate">vincristine</DrugRef></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_158">Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.</Para><Para id="_159">Learn more about how chemotherapy works, how it is given, common side effects, and more at <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/chemotherapy">Chemotherapy to Treat Cancer</ExternalRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_71"><Title>Radiation therapy </Title><Para id="_72">Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.

     <ListItem>Radioembolization is a type of internal radiation therapy used to treat childhood hepatocellular carcinoma. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is attached to tiny beads that are injected into the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) through a thin tube called a catheter. The beads are mixed with a substance that blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the radiation is trapped near the tumor to kill the cancer cells. This is done to shrink the tumor or  to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life for children with hepatocellular carcinoma. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_74">Learn more about radiation therapy and its side effects at <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/radiation-therapy">Radiation Therapy to Treat Cancer</ExternalRef> and <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/radiation-therapy/side-effects">Radiation Therapy Side Effects</ExternalRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_75"><Title>Antiviral treatment  </Title><Para id="_76">Hepatocellular carcinoma that is linked to the hepatitis B virus may be treated with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046088" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">antiviral</GlossaryTermRef> drugs.
