When a linked term is clicked, the definition will appear in a separate window.</Note></Para><Para id="_2692"><Note>A concerted effort is being made within the genetics community to shift terminology used to describe genetic variation. The shift is to use the term “variant” rather than the term “mutation” to describe a difference that exists between the person or group being studied and the reference sequence. Variants can then be further classified as benign (harmless), likely benign, of uncertain significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic (disease causing). Throughout this summary, we will use the term pathogenic variant to describe a disease-causing mutation. Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000517309#_2676" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/overview-hp-pdq">Cancer Genetics Overview</SummaryRef> summary for more information about variant classification.</Note></Para><Para id="_37">Creating evidence-based summaries on cancer genetics is challenging because the rapid evolution of new information often results in evidence that is incomplete or of limited quality.  In addition, established methods for evaluating the quality of the evidence are available for some, but not all, aspects of cancer genetics.  Varying levels of evidence are available for different topics, and PDQ summaries are subject to modification as new evidence becomes available.  As in other areas of medicine, testing and treatment decisions must be based on information that sometimes falls short of the optimal level of evidence. Recognizing the limits inherent in certain observations will alter the weight given to recommendations based on that evidence and serves to keep minds open to new improved information as it comes along.</Para><Para id="_38">The quality of evidence depends on the appropriateness of the study in terms of the question being evaluated and on how well the study was designed, implemented, analyzed, and interpreted. For evaluating outcomes of both medical and social interventions, the strongest evidence is obtained from well-designed and well-conducted randomized clinical trials.  For evaluating other questions, particularly those related to the prevalence of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">gene</GlossaryTermRef> variants and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339343" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">inherited syndromes</GlossaryTermRef> and determining the clinical validity of genetic tests, the strongest evidence is obtained from well-designed descriptive studies.  Particular elements of study design, such as the nature of the population studied or the duration of observation, may be crucial to assessing the quality of a study. </Para><Para id="_39">During the early phases of research in a new area, information relevant to the needs of patients and clinicians may come from work at all levels of evidence, including well-designed quasi-experimental studies (nonrandomized, controlled single-group, pre/post, cohort, time, or matched case-control studies) or nonexperimental studies (case reports, clinical examples, qualitative or narrative studies, or theoretical work).  Such research may yield information important to patients and clinicians, who must make treatment or risk management decisions before full data on the risks and benefits of cancer genetic testing are available.  In addition, such work helps to inform future research using more rigorous designs.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_15"><Title>Study Populations</Title><Para id="_16">The level of evidence required for informed decision making about genetic testing depends on the circumstances of testing.  Evidence from a sample of high-risk families may be sufficient to provide useful information for testing decisions among people with similar family histories but is likely to be insufficient to make early recommendations for, or decisions about, testing in families with less dramatic histories or in the general population.  Even among people with similar family histories, however, other contributing <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">genes</GlossaryTermRef> or different exposures could modify the effect of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000776887" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">genetic variant</GlossaryTermRef> in different families.   In evaluating evidence, the most important consideration is the relevance of the available data to the patient for whom a genetic assessment is being considered.  In summaries addressing the cancer risk associated with genetic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044805" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">polymorphisms</GlossaryTermRef> and variants, the study populations used for each <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460214" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">risk assessment</GlossaryTermRef> will be noted, according to the following categories. </Para><OrderedList id="_40" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Population-based.</ListItem><ListItem>	Proxy for population-based.

For any given therapy, results of prevention and treatment studies can be ranked on each of the following two scales:</Para><OrderedList id="_96" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Strength of the study design.</ListItem><ListItem>Strength of the endpoints.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_97"> Together, the two rankings provide a measure of the overall level of evidence. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046171" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">Screening</GlossaryTermRef> studies are ranked on strength of study design alone. Depending on perspective, different expert panels, professional organizations, or individual physicians may use different cutoff points related to overall strength of evidence in formulating therapeutic guidelines or in taking action; however, a formal description of the level of evidence provides a uniform framework for the data, leading to specific recommendations.</Para><Para id="_41">There are varying levels of evidence related to screening, prevention, and treatment that support a given summary. The summaries are subject to modification as new evidence becomes available. The strongest evidence would be that obtained from a well-designed and well-conducted randomized controlled trial. It is not always practical,  however to conduct such a trial to address every question in the fields of cancer screening, prevention, and treatment.</Para><SummarySection id="_19"><Title>Evidence Related to Screening</Title><Para id="_20">The <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/genetics">PDQ Cancer Genetics Editorial Board</ExternalRef> has adopted the following definitions related to screening: </Para><ItemizedList id="_42" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Screening is a means of accomplishing early detection of disease in people without symptoms of the disease being sought. </ListItem><ListItem>Examinations, tests, or procedures used in cancer screening are often not definitive but sort out persons suspected of harboring a clinically occult cancer from those in whom a cancer is not likely to be present. </ListItem><ListItem>Diagnosis of disease is made after a workup, biopsy, or other tests are completed in pursuing symptoms or following positive detection procedures. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_43">The five requirements that should be met before it is considered appropriate to screen for a particular medical condition as part of routine medical practice are as follows:<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><OrderedList id="_44" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>The medical condition being sought must cause a substantial burden of suffering, measured both as mortality and as the frequency and severity of morbidity and loss of function.</ListItem><ListItem>A screening test or procedure exists that will detect cancers earlier in their natural history than when diagnosis is prompted by symptoms, and this test must be acceptable to patients and society in terms of convenience, comfort, risk, and cost.</ListItem><ListItem>Strong evidence exists that early detection and treatment improve disease outcomes, particularly disease-specific survival.</ListItem><ListItem>The harms of screening must be known and acceptable.</ListItem><ListItem>Screening must be judged to do more good than harm, considering all benefits and harms it induces in addition to  the cost and cost-effectiveness of the screening program.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_45">In descending order of strength of evidence, the five levels for screening studies are as follows:</Para><OrderedList id="_46" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Evidence obtained from at least one well-designed and well-conducted randomized controlled trial.</ListItem><ListItem>Evidence obtained from well-designed and well-conducted nonrandomized controlled trials.</ListItem><ListItem>Evidence obtained from well-designed and well-conducted cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</ListItem><ListItem>Evidence obtained from multiple time series, with or without intervention.</ListItem><ListItem>Opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</ListItem></OrderedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_21"><Title>Evidence Related to Cancer Prevention</Title><Para id="_22">Prevention is defined as a reduction in the incidence (or the rate) of new cancer, with the goal of reducing cancer-related morbidity and mortality.

In the case of family history, analytic validity refers to the accuracy of the reported family history information.  In the case of a test for a specific <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000783960" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">pathogenic variant</GlossaryTermRef>, analytic validity refers to the accuracy of a genetic test in identifying the presence or absence of the variant.  The technical accuracy and reliability of the testing procedure and the quality of the laboratory processes (including specimen handling) affect the analytic validity of a genetic assessment.</Para><Para id="_61">Assessing analytic validity is complex for some genetic tests.  For example, in a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000763019" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">panel test</GlossaryTermRef>, which is designed to evaluate a particular set of variants (e.g., the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460127" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">Ashkenazi</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000783962" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">founder pathogenic variants</GlossaryTermRef> in the<GeneName> BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">genes</GlossaryTermRef>), the analytic validity of the different components of the test may vary.  Some genetic tests involve evaluating the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045671" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">DNA</GlossaryTermRef> sequence of portions of a gene to determine whether any pathogenic variants are present (including variants not previously identified).  The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322883" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">sensitivity</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322884" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">specificity</GlossaryTermRef> of these sequencing tests may vary with the laboratory techniques employed, the proportion of the gene tested, and the structural nature of the pathogenic variants present in the gene. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_27"><Title>Clinical Validity</Title><Para id="_28">Clinical validity refers to the predictive value of a test for a given clinical outcome (e.g., the likelihood that cancer will develop in someone with a positive test). It is primarily determined by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322883" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">sensitivity</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322884" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">specificity</GlossaryTermRef> with which a test identifies people with a defined clinical condition within a given population.  Sensitivity of a test refers to the proportion of people who test positive for a clinical condition among those who actually have the clinical condition; specificity refers to the proportion of people who test negative for a clinical condition among those who do not have the clinical condition.  In the case of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000256553" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">genetic susceptibility</GlossaryTermRef> to cancer, clinical validity can be considered at two levels: </Para><OrderedList id="_87" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Does a positive test identify a person as having an increased risk of cancer?</ListItem><ListItem>If so, how high is the cancer risk associated with a positive test? </ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_62">Thus, the clinical validity of a genetic test is the likelihood that cancer will develop in someone with a positive test result. This likelihood is affected not only by the presence of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000776887" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">genetic variant</GlossaryTermRef> itself but also by any other modifying factors that might affect the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339344" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">penetrance</GlossaryTermRef> of the variant (e.g., the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460132" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">carrier's</GlossaryTermRef> environmental exposures or personal behaviors) or by the presence or absence of variants in other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">genes</GlossaryTermRef>.  For this reason, the clinical validity of a genetic test for a specific genetic variant may vary in different populations.  If the cancer risk associated with a given variant is unknown or variable, a test for the variant will have uncertain clinical validity. A summary of definitions of concepts relevant to understanding clinical validity and other aspects of cancer genetics testing has been published.<Reference refidx="1"/> The test should be evaluated in the population in which the test will be used.</Para><Para id="_63">Clues to whether a particular <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460148" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">familial</GlossaryTermRef> cancer syndrome has a genetic basis can be derived informally, by inspecting the pattern of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460124" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">affected</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460224" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">unaffected</GlossaryTermRef> people in a series of families; or formally, using an analytic technique known as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000712689" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">segregation analysis</GlossaryTermRef>. Segregation analysis provides quantitative data in support of, or against, the likelihood that a particular genetic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460196" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">mode of inheritance</GlossaryTermRef> might explain the patterns observed in the study families. </Para><Para id="_64">Evidence that a particular gene might explain a specific cancer predisposition syndrome often derives initially from <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460161" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">linkage</GlossaryTermRef> studies that use collections of families meeting stringent clinical criteria for a specific cancer susceptibility syndrome.  The demonstration of strong linkage of cancer susceptibility to a gene or genetic region in a pattern consistent with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000793860" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">autosomal dominant inheritance</GlossaryTermRef> provides evidence in support of both the mode of inheritance and the particular gene that might underlie the risk. Once linkage is established, a strong case for association between the genetic trait and disease can be made, even though the families used in the study may not be representative of the general population.  The genetic trait measured in linkage studies is not always the causal factor itself but may be a genetic trait closely linked to it.  Additional molecular studies are required to identify the specific gene associated with inherited risk, after linkage studies have determined its general <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046470" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">chromosomal</GlossaryTermRef> location. </Para><Para id="_65">Linkage studies, however, provide only limited evidence concerning either the range of cancer types associated with a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000783960" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">pathogenic variant</GlossaryTermRef> or the magnitude of risk and lifetime probability of cancer conferred by a pathogenic variant in less selected populations.  In addressing these questions, the best information for clinical decisions comes from naturally occurring populations in which people with all degrees of risk are represented, similar to those in which clinical or public health decisions must be made.  Thus, observations about cancer risk in families having multiple members with early breast cancer are applicable only to other families meeting those same clinical criteria.  Ideally, the families tested should also have similar exposures to factors that can modify the expression of the gene(s) being studied.  The risk associated with a pathogenic variant in other populations, such as families with less dramatic cancer aggregation, or in the general population can best be assessed by direct study of those populations.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="12107021" MedlineID="22103373">Grann VR, Jacobson JS: Population screening for cancer-related germline gene mutations.
