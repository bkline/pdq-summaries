For noninvasive SCC, the term carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> is used. Histologically, invasive carcinomas are classified  as well differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated, or undifferentiated. SCCs are usually moderately or poorly differentiated.<Reference refidx="4"/> Grading the deep invasive margins (i.e., invasive front) of SCC may provide better prognostic information than grading the entire tumor.<Reference refidx="5"/> Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancers arising from the lingual and palatine tonsils are a distinct molecular-pathological entity that is linked to infection with HPV, especially HPV-16. Compared with HPV-negative tumors, HPV-positive tumors are more frequently poorly differentiated and nonkeratinizing. They are strongly associated with basaloid morphology and less likely to have <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> variants.<Reference refidx="6"/> </Para><Para id="_444">Immunohistochemical examination of tissues for the expression of the biomarker Ki-67, a proliferation antigen, may complement histological grading. As a molecular indicator of epithelial dysplasia of the oropharynx, Ki-67 expression appears to correlate well with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumor cells. In a retrospective study involving 43 tissue samples from 25 patients, the assessment of proliferation with Ki-67 was a better surrogate for LOH than was histological grading.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_445">Other types of oropharyngeal cancer include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_239" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Minor salivary gland tumors.</ListItem><ListItem>Lymphomas.</ListItem><ListItem>Lymphoepitheliomas (e.g., tonsillar fossa).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_240">For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062920" url="/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/salivary-gland-treatment-pdq">Salivary Gland Cancer Treatment</SummaryRef>, <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062675" url="/types/lymphoma/hp/adult-hodgkin-treatment-pdq">Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment</SummaryRef>, <SummaryRef href="CDR0000811546" url="/types/lymphoma/hp/indolent-b-cell-lymphoma-treatment-pdq">Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment</SummaryRef>, <SummaryRef href="CDR0000816140" url="/types/lymphoma/hp/aggressive-b-cell-lymphoma-treatment-pdq">Aggressive B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment</SummaryRef>, and  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000811763" url="/types/lymphoma/hp/peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma-pdq">Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment</SummaryRef>.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Mendenhall WM, Werning JW, Pfister DG: Treatment of head and neck cancer.
