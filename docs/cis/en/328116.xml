More than 90% of adults express a belief in God, and slightly more than 70% of individuals surveyed identified religion as one of the most important influences in their lives.<Reference refidx="1"/> Yet even widely held beliefs, such as survival of the soul after death or a belief in miracles, vary substantially by gender, education, and ethnicity.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_159">Research indicates that both  patients and family caregivers <Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> commonly rely on spirituality and religion to help them deal with serious physical illnesses, with a desire to have specific spiritual and religious needs acknowledged or addressed by medical staff. These needs, although widespread, may take different forms between and within cultural and religious traditions.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_160">A survey of hospital inpatients found that 77% of them reported that physicians should take patients' spiritual needs into consideration, and 37% wanted physicians to address religious beliefs more frequently.<Reference refidx="8"/> A large survey of cancer outpatients in New York City found that a slight majority felt it was appropriate for a physician to inquire about their religious beliefs and spiritual needs, although only 1% reported that this had occurred. Patients who reported that spiritual needs were not being met gave lower ratings to quality of care (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .01) and reported lower satisfaction with care (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .01).<Reference refidx="7"/>  A pilot study of 14 African American men with a history of prostate cancer found that most  had discussed spirituality and religious beliefs with their physicians. They expressed a desire for their doctors and clergy to be in contact with each other.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_161">In addition, 61% of 57 inpatients with advanced cancer receiving end-of-life care in a hospital supported by the Catholic archdiocese reported spiritual distress when interviewed by hospital chaplains.  The intensity of spiritual distress correlated with self-reports of depression but not with physical pain or perceived severity of illness.<Reference refidx="10"/> Another study<Reference refidx="11"/> of patients with advanced cancer (N = 230) in New England and Texas assessed spiritual needs.  Almost half (47%) reported that their spiritual needs were not being met by a religious community, and 72% reported that these needs were not supported by the medical system. When such support existed, it was positively related to improved quality of life. Furthermore, having the medical care team address spiritual issues had more impact than did pastoral counseling on increasing hospice use and decreasing aggressive end-of-life measures.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_7">This summary will review the following topics:</Para><ItemizedList id="_8" Style="bullet"><ListItem>How religion and spirituality can be conceptualized within the medical setting.</ListItem><ListItem>The empirical evidence for the importance of religious and spiritual factors in adjustment to illness in general and to cancer in particular, throughout the course of illness and at the end of life, for both patients and family caregivers.<Reference refidx="3"/></ListItem><ListItem>The range of assessment approaches that may be useful in a clinical environment.</ListItem><ListItem>Various models for management and intervention.</ListItem><ListItem>Resources  for clinical care.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_9">Paying attention to the religious or spiritual beliefs of seriously ill patients has a long tradition within inpatient medical environments. Addressing such issues has  been viewed as the domain of hospital chaplains or a patient’s own religious leader. In this context, systematic assessment has usually been limited to identifying a patient’s religious preference, while responsibility for management of apparent spiritual distress has fallen to the chaplain service.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/>  Although health care providers may address such concerns themselves, they are generally very ambivalent about doing so,<Reference refidx="16"/>  and there has been relatively little systematic investigation addressing the physician’s role. These issues, however, are increasingly addressed in medical training.<Reference refidx="17"/> Acknowledging the role of all health care professionals in spirituality, a multidisciplinary group from one cancer center  developed a  four-stage model that allows health care professionals to deliver spiritual care consistent with their knowledge, skills, and actions at one of four skill levels.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_10">Interest in and recognition of the function of religious and spiritual coping in  adjustment to serious illness, including cancer, has been growing.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/>  New ways to assess and address religious and spiritual concerns as part of overall quality of life are being developed and tested. Limited data support the possibility that spiritual coping is one of the most powerful means by which patients draw on their own resources to deal with a serious illness such as cancer. However,  patients and their family caregivers may be reluctant to raise religious and spiritual concerns with  their professional health care providers.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/> Increased spiritual well-being in a seriously ill population may be linked with lower anxiety about death,<Reference refidx="27"/> but greater religious involvement may also be linked to an increased likelihood of desire for extreme measures at the end of life.<Reference refidx="28"/>  Given the importance of religion and spirituality to patients, integrating systematic assessment of such needs into medical care, including outpatient care, is crucial.  The development of better assessment tools will make it easier to discern which aspects of religious and spiritual coping may be important in a particular patient’s adjustment to illness.</Para><Para id="_11">Of equal importance is the consideration of how and when to address religion and spirituality with patients and the best ways to do so in different medical environments.<Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/>  Although addressing spiritual concerns is often considered an end-of-life issue, such concerns may arise at any time after diagnosis.<Reference refidx="24"/> Acknowledging the importance of these concerns and addressing them, even briefly, at diagnosis may facilitate better adjustment throughout the course of treatment and create a context for richer dialogue later in the illness.  One study of 118 patients seen in follow-up by one of four oncologists suggests that a semistructured inquiry into spiritual concerns related to coping with cancer is well accepted by patients and oncologists and is associated with positive perceptions of care and well-being.<Reference refidx="32"/></Para><Para id="_1_md_4">In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed.

Although this distinction may not be salient or important on a personal basis, it is important conceptually for understanding various aspects of evaluation and the role of different beliefs, practices, and experiences in coping with cancer.</Para><Para id="_12">The most useful general distinction in this context is between religion and spirituality. There is no general agreement on definitions of either term, but there is general agreement on the usefulness of this distinction.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_181" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem><Strong>Religion</Strong> can be viewed as a specific set of beliefs and practices associated   with a recognized religion or denomination.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Spirituality</Strong> is generally recognized as encompassing experiential aspects, whether related to engaging in religious practices or acknowledging a general sense of peace and connectedness. Found in all cultures, the concept of spirituality is often considered to encompass a search for ultimate meaning through religion or other paths.<Reference refidx="4"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_182">In health care, concerns about spiritual or religious well-being have sometimes been viewed as an aspect of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), but this perception may be more characteristic of providers than of patients.  In one study,<Reference refidx="5"/> virtually no patients but about 20% of providers said that CAM services were sought to assist with spiritual or religious issues. </Para><Para id="_183">Religion is highly culturally determined. Spirituality is considered a universal human capacity, usually—but not necessarily—associated with and expressed in religious practice.  Most individuals consider themselves both spiritual and religious. Some may consider themselves religious but not spiritual; others, including some atheists (people who do not believe in the existence of God) or agnostics (people who believe that God cannot be shown to exist), may consider themselves spiritual but not religious. In a sample of 369 representative cancer outpatients in New York City (33% minority groups), 6% identified themselves as agnostic or atheist, 29% attended religious services weekly; and 66% represented themselves as spiritual but not religious.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_119">One effort to characterize individuals by types of spiritual and religious experience <Reference refidx="7"/> identified the following three groups, using cluster analytic techniques:</Para><OrderedList id="_13" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Religious individuals who highly value religious faith, spiritual well-being, and the meaning of life.</ListItem><ListItem>Existential individuals who highly value spiritual well-being but not religious faith.</ListItem><ListItem>Nonspiritual individuals who have  little value for religiousness, spirituality, or a sense of the meaning of life. </ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_14">Individuals in the third group were far more distressed about their illness and experienced worse adjustment than the other two groups.  There is not yet consensus on the number or types of underlying dimensions of spirituality or religious engagement.</Para><Para id="_15">From the perspective of both the research and clinical literature on the relationships among religion, spirituality, and health, it is important to consider how investigators and authors define and use these concepts. Much of the epidemiological literature that indicates a relationship between religion and health is based on definitions of religious involvement such as:</Para><ItemizedList id="_184" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Membership in a religious group.</ListItem><ListItem>Frequency of attendance at religious services.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_185">Assessing specific beliefs or religious practices such as belief in God, frequency of prayer, or reading religious material is somewhat more complex. Individuals may engage in such practices or believe in God without necessarily attending services. Terminology also carries certain connotations. The term <Emphasis>religiosity</Emphasis>, for example, has a history of  implying fervor and perhaps undue investment in particular religious practices or beliefs. The term <Strong>religiousness</Strong> may be a more neutral way to refer to the dimension of religious practice.</Para><Para id="_16"><Strong>Spirituality</Strong> and <Strong>spiritual well-being</Strong> are more challenging to define.  Some definitions limit spirituality to mean profound mystical experiences. However, in effects on health and psychological well-being, the more helpful definitions focus on accessible feelings, such as:</Para><ItemizedList id="_186" Style="bullet"><ListItem> A sense of inner peace.</ListItem><ListItem>Existential meaning.</ListItem><ListItem>Awe when walking in nature.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_187">This discussion assumes a continuum of meaningful spiritual experiences, from the common and accessible to the extraordinary and transformative. Both type and intensity of experience may vary. Other aspects of spirituality that have been identified by those working with patients include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_188" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>A sense of meaning and peace.</ListItem><ListItem>A sense of faith.</ListItem><ListItem>A sense of connectedness to others or to God.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_189">  Low levels of these experiences may be associated with poorer coping.<Reference refidx="3"/> For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000328116#_18" url="/about-cancer/coping/day-to-day/faith-and-spirituality/spirituality-hp-pdq">Religion, Spirituality, and Living With Cancer</SummaryRef> section.</Para><Para id="_17">The definition of <Strong>acute spiritual distress</Strong> must be considered separately. Spiritual distress may result from the belief that cancer reflects punishment by God or may accompany a preoccupation with the question “Why me?” A cancer patient may also suffer a loss of faith.<Reference refidx="8"/>   Although many individuals may have such thoughts at some point after diagnosis, only a few become obsessed with these thoughts or score high on a general measure of religious and spiritual distress (such as the Negative subscale of the Religious Coping Scale).<Reference refidx="8"/>     High levels of spiritual distress may contribute to poorer health and psychosocial outcomes.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/>    The tools for measuring these dimensions are described in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000328116#_22" url="/about-cancer/coping/day-to-day/faith-and-spirituality/spirituality-hp-pdq">Screening and Assessment of Spiritual Concerns</SummaryRef> section.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="9392027" MedlineID="98053515">Halstead MT, Mickley JR: Attempting to fathom the unfathomable: descriptive views of spirituality.

There was also a negative correlation between the existential well-being scores and the anxiety and depression scores but not with the religious well-being score (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001).<Reference refidx="15"/> These patterns were also found in a large study of indigent survivors of prostate cancer; the patterns were consistent across ethnicity and metastatic status.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_149"> In a large (N = 418) study of breast cancer patients, a higher level of meaning and peace was associated with a decline in depression over 12 months, whereas higher religiousness predicted an increase in depression, particularly if the sense of meaning/peace was lower.<Reference refidx="17"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  A second study with mixed gender/mixed cancer survivors (N = 165) found similar patterns.

Low scores in spirituality, as measured by the peace/meaning and faith subscale of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy—Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp), were associated with significantly worse physical and mental health than were high scores in spirituality.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_168">A large national survey of 361 paired U.S. survivors (52% women) and caregivers (including spouses and adult children) found that for both survivors and caregivers, the peace factor of the FACIT-Sp was strongly related to mental health but negligibly or not at all related to physical well-being.  The faith factor (“religiousness”) was unrelated to physical or mental well-being.<Reference refidx="19"/> These findings support the value of the FACIT-Sp in separating people’s religious involvement from their sense of spiritual well-being and that it is this sense of spiritual well-being that seems to be most related to psychological adjustment.</Para><Para id="_150">Another large national survey study of female family caregivers (N = 252; 89% White) found that higher  levels of spirituality, as measured by the FACIT-Sp, were associated with much less psychological distress (measured by the Pearlin Stress Scale). Participants with higher levels of spirituality actually had improved well-being even as the stress caused by caregiving increased, while those with lower levels of spirituality showed the opposite pattern. This finding suggests a strong stress-buffering effect of spiritual well-being and reinforces the need to identify low spiritual well-being when assessing the coping capacity of family caregivers as well as patients.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_180">Data from the National Quality of Life Survey for Caregivers were used to examine the effects of spirituality on caregiving motivation and satisfaction. Caregivers received a baseline survey to measure motivation 2 years after a family member’s cancer diagnosis and again at 5 years after diagnosis. Male caregivers were more likely to report internal/spiritual motives for caregiving, whereas the motives of female caregivers were not related to internal/spiritual reasons. However, both men and women who were able to identify a sense of spiritual peace in their caregiving efforts had better mental health after 5 years of caregiving.

The study found that increasing levels of   spiritual struggle were related to poorer emotional adjustment, though not to other aspects of cancer-related quality of life.<Reference refidx="22"/> Using path analytic techniques, a study of women with breast cancer found that at both prediagnosis and 6 months postsurgery, holding negative images of God was the strongest predictor of emotional distress and lower social well-being.<Reference refidx="23"/> However, longitudinal analyses failed to find sustained effects for baseline positive or negative attitudes toward God at either 6 or 12 months. One possible explanation for these findings is that such attitudes are somewhat unstable during a period of uncertainty (e.g., at prediagnosis).<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_152">Engaging in prayer is often cited as an adaptive tool,<Reference refidx="24"/>  but qualitative research <Reference refidx="25"/> found that for about one-third of cancer patients interviewed, concerns about how to pray effectively or the questions raised about the effectiveness of prayer also caused inner conflict and mild distress. In another study, of 123 patients hospitalized on a palliative care unit, 26.8% reported having used spiritual healing and prayer for curative purposes, 35% for improving survival, and 36.6% for improving symptoms (note: these percentages overlap). Higher levels of faith on the FACIT-Sp were associated with greater use of complementary and alternative medicine techniques in general  and with interest in future use, whereas the level of meaning/peace was not. The study also looked at the general use of complementary therapies.<Reference refidx="26"/>  A useful discussion of how patients with cancer use prayer and how clinicians might conceptualize prayer has been published.<Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_135">Ethnicity and spirituality were investigated in a qualitative study of 161 breast cancer survivors.<Reference refidx="28"/>  In individual interviews, most participants (83%) spoke about some aspect of their spirituality.

Spiritual support by religious communities or the medical system was associated with better  patient quality of life.  Age was not associated with religiousness.  At the time of recruitment, increasing self-reported distress was associated with increasing religiousness, and private religious or spiritual activities were performed by a larger percentage of patients after their diagnosis (61%) than before (47%).  Regarding spiritual support, 38% reported that their spiritual needs were supported by a religious community “to a large extent or completely,” while 47% reported receiving support from a religious community “to a small extent or not at all.” Finally, religiousness was also associated with preference of “wanting all measures taken to extend life” at the end of life.</Para><Para id="_200">Another study <Reference refidx="31"/> found that helper and cytotoxic T-cell counts were higher among women with metastatic breast cancer who reported greater importance of spirituality.  Other investigators <Reference refidx="32"/> found that attendance at religious services was associated with better immune system functioning.

These associations, however, have been criticized as weak and inconsistent.<Reference refidx="35"/></Para><Para id="_21">Several randomized trials with cancer patients have suggested that group support interventions benefit survival.<Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/>    These studies must be interpreted cautiously, however.  First, the treatments focused on general psychotherapeutic issues and  psychosocial support. Although spiritually relevant issues undoubtedly arose in these settings, they were not the focus of the groups.

These measures have the advantage of being self-administered; however, they were mostly designed as research tools, and their role for clinical assessment purposes is not as  well understood. These measures may be helpful in opening up the topic for exploration and for ascertaining basic levels of religious engagement or spiritual well-being (or spiritual distress). Most tools  assume a belief in God and may seem inappropriate for an atheist or agnostic patient, who may still be spiritually oriented. All of the measures have undergone varying degrees of psychometric development, and most are being used in investigations of the relationship between religion or spirituality, health indices, and adjustment to illness.</Para><ItemizedList id="_31" Style="bullet"><ListItem><Strong>Duke Religious Index (DRI)</Strong>:  The DRI (or  DUREL) <Reference refidx="5"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]<Reference refidx="6"/> is short (five items) and has reasonable psychometric properties <Reference refidx="5"/>   examined in patients with cancer.

The second factor appears to uniquely identify an  important aspect of spiritual adjustment, i.e., the degree to which conflict, self-blame, or anger at God is present for an individual.  A longer form of the scale, with additional dimensions, would be suitable for a more comprehensive assessment of religious/spiritual concerns. Psychometric development is high. While high scores in negative religious coping are unusual, they are particularly powerful in predicting poor adjustment to disease.<Reference refidx="9"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy—Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp)</Strong>:<Reference refidx="10"/>  The FACIT-Sp is part of the widely used Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy quality-of-life battery.<Reference refidx="11"/>   Developed with an ethnically diverse cancer population, it  contains 12 items and 2 factors (faith, and meaning and peace), with good to excellent psychometric properties. Although some evidence suggests that inner meaning and inner peace can be identified as two separate factors, such identification does not appear to substantially improve associations with other indicators of well-being.<Reference refidx="12"/> One characteristic of this scale is that the wording of items does not assume a belief in God. Therefore, it can be comfortably completed by an atheist or agnostic, yet it taps into both traditional religiousness dimensions (faith factor) and spiritual dimensions (meaning and peace factor).<Para id="_201">The meaning and peace factor has been shown to have particularly strong associations with psychological adjustment, in that individuals who score high on this scale are much more likely to report enjoying life despite fatigue or pain, are less likely to desire a hastened death at the end of life,<Reference refidx="13"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  report better disease-specific and psychosocial adjustment,<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/> and report lower levels of helplessness/hopelessness.<Reference refidx="16"/> These associations have been shown to be independent of other indicators of adjustment, supporting the value of adding religious and spiritual assessment to standard quality-of-life evaluations.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="16"/> Total scores on the FACIT-Sp correlated highly over time (27 weeks) with a 10-point linear analogue scale of spiritual well-being in a sample of patients with advanced cancer.

Individuals with higher SD scores were more likely to have not graduated from high school. A unique strength of this scale is that it is specific to change in spirituality since diagnosis; the wording of items is also generally appropriate for individuals who identify as spiritual rather than religious. Among the limitations is  that development to date includes mostly observant Christians, with few minority individuals in the sample.</Para></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_32"><Title>Interviewing Tools</Title><Para id="_33">The following semistructured interviewing tools are designed to facilitate an exploration of religious beliefs and spiritual experiences or issues by the physician or other health care provider.

Although one study <Reference refidx="7"/> found that more than one-half of the patients surveyed expressed a desire to have physicians pray with them, a large proportion did not express this preference. A qualitative study of cancer patients <Reference refidx="8"/> found that they were concerned that physicians are too busy, not interested, or even prohibited from discussing religion. At the same time, patients generally wanted their physicians to acknowledge the value of spiritual and religious issues. A suggestion was made that physicians might raise the question of prayer by asking, “Would that comfort you?”</Para><Para id="_166">In a study of 70 patients with advanced cancer, 206 oncology physicians, and 115 oncology nurses, all participants were interviewed about the appropriateness of patient-practitioner prayer in the advanced-cancer setting. Results showed that 71% of patients, 83% of nurses, and 65% of physicians reported that it is occasionally appropriate for a practitioner to pray with a patient when the patient initiates the request.  Similarly, 64% of patients, 76% of nurses, and 59% of physicians reported that they consider it appropriate for a religious/spiritual health care practitioner to pray for a patient.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_167">The most important guideline is to remain sensitive to the patient’s preference. Asking patients about their beliefs or spiritual concerns in the context of exploring how they are coping in general is the most viable approach in exploring these issues.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_45"><Title>Hospital Chaplains</Title><Para id="_46">Traditionally, hospital chaplains deliver religious or spiritual assistance to patients.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/>  Hospital chaplains can play a key role because they are trained to work with a wide range of issues as they arise for patients and to be sensitive to patients' diverse beliefs and concerns.<Reference refidx="12"/> Chaplains are generally available in large medical centers but may not be reliably available in smaller hospitals.  Chaplains are rarely available in  outpatient settings where most cancer care is now delivered (especially early in the course of cancer treatment, when these issues may first arise).
