The natural history of some of these syndromes is still being described. Many other families exhibit aggregation of CRC and/or adenomas, but with no apparent association with an identifiable hereditary syndrome, and they are known collectively as familial CRC. In addition, most individuals with CRC diagnosed before age 50 years and without a family history of cancer do not have a pathogenic variant associated with an inherited cancer syndrome.</Para><Para id="_2906"><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_3375" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Genome-wide searches</SummaryRef> are showing promise in identifying common, low-penetrance susceptibility alleles for many complex diseases, including CRCs, but the clinical utility of these findings remains uncertain.</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Clinical Management</Strong><Para id="_2907">It is becoming the standard of care at many centers that all individuals with newly diagnosed CRC are evaluated for Lynch syndrome through molecular diagnostic tumor testing assessing MMR deficiency. A <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1110" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">universal screening approach to tumor testing</SummaryRef> is supported, in which all CRC cases are evaluated regardless of age at diagnosis or fulfillment of existing clinical criteria for Lynch syndrome. A more cost-effective approach has been reported whereby all patients aged 70 years or younger with CRC  and older patients who meet the revised Bethesda guidelines are tested for Lynch syndrome. Tumor evaluation often begins with <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1105" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">immunohistochemistry testing</SummaryRef> for the expression of the MMR proteins associated with Lynch syndrome or <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_3119" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">microsatellite instability (MSI) testing</SummaryRef>, <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> testing, and <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName> hypermethylation analyses.</Para><Para id="_2908">Colonoscopy for CRC screening and surveillance is commonly performed in individuals with hereditary CRC syndromes and has been associated with improved survival outcomes. For example, <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1144" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">surveillance of Lynch syndrome patients with colonoscopy</SummaryRef> every 1 to 2 years, and in one study up to 3 years, has been shown to reduce CRC incidence and mortality. <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_2975" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Extracolonic surveillance</SummaryRef> is also a mainstay for some hereditary CRC syndromes depending on the other cancers associated with the syndrome. For example, regular <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_613" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">endoscopic surveillance of the duodenum in FAP patients</SummaryRef> has been shown to improve survival.</Para><Para id="_3117">Prophylactic surgery (colectomy) has also been shown to improve survival in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_263" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">patients with FAP</SummaryRef>. The timing and extent of risk-reducing surgery usually depends on the number of polyps, their size, histology, and symptomatology. For <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1147" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">patients with Lynch syndrome</SummaryRef> and a diagnosis of CRC, extended resection is associated with fewer metachronous CRCs and additional surgical procedures for colorectal neoplasia than in patients who undergo segmental resection for CRC. The surgical decision must consider the age of the patient, comorbidities, clinical stage of the tumor, sphincter function, and the patient’s wishes. </Para><Para id="_2910">Chemopreventive agents have also been studied in the management of FAP and Lynch syndrome. In FAP patients, <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_265" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">celecoxib and sulindac</SummaryRef> have been associated with a decrease in polyp size and number. A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of sulindac plus an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_2894" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">erlotinib</SummaryRef>, versus placebo in FAP or AFAP patients with duodenal polyps suggested that erlotinib has the potential to inhibit duodenal polyps in FAP patients. An ongoing trial will determine whether lower doses of erlotinib alone will significantly reduce duodenal polyp burden. <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1148" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Aspirin</SummaryRef> use (600 mg daily) was shown to have a preventive effect on cancer incidence in Lynch syndrome patients in a large randomized trial; lower doses are being examined in an ongoing study.</Para><Para id="_2912"><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_3076" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Novel therapies that stimulate the immune system</SummaryRef> have been evaluated in MMR-deficient tumors, including those related to Lynch syndrome.   The dense immune infiltration and cytokine-rich environment in MMR-deficient tumors may improve clinical outcomes.  A critical pathway responsible for mediating tumor-induced immune suppression is the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)–mediated checkpoint pathway.   Two phase 2 studies using anti–PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) demonstrated favorable outcomes, including progression-free survival, radiographic response rates, and disease control rates in metastatic CRC with MMR deficiency and MSI that had progressed on prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab has shown similar benefit in other noncolorectal cancers with MMR deficiency and MSI, but not in tumors that are microsatellite stable.</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Psychosocial and Behavioral Issues</Strong><Para id="_2911"><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_189" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Psychosocial factors</SummaryRef> influence decisions about genetic testing for inherited cancer risk and risk-management strategies. Uptake of genetic counseling and genetic testing for <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_2924" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Lynch syndrome</SummaryRef> and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_2942" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">FAP</SummaryRef> varies widely across studies. Factors that have been associated with genetic counseling and testing uptake in Lynch syndrome families include having children, the number of affected relatives, perceived risk of developing CRC, and frequency of thoughts about CRC. Psychological studies have shown <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_2925" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">low levels of distress</SummaryRef>, particularly in the long term, after genetic testing for Lynch syndrome in both carriers and noncarriers. However, other studies have demonstrated the possibility of increased distress following genetic testing for FAP. Colon and gynecologic cancer screening rates have been shown to increase or be maintained among carriers of MMR pathogenic variants within the year after disclosure of results, while screening rates decrease among noncarriers. The latter is expected as the screening recommendations for unaffected individuals are those that apply to the general population. Studies measuring quality-of-life variables in FAP patients show normal-range results; however, these studies suggest that risk-reducing surgery for FAP may have negative quality-of-life effects for at least some proportion of those affected.   Patients' communication with their family members about an inherited risk of CRC is complex; gender, age, and the degree of relatedness are some elements that affect disclosure of this information. Research is ongoing to better understand and address psychosocial and behavioral issues in high-risk families.</Para></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1"><Title>Introduction</Title><Para id="_1346">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women.</Para><Para id="_1347">Estimated new cases and deaths from CRC in 2024 in the United States:<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_1348" Style="bullet"><ListItem>New cases: 152,810.</ListItem><ListItem>Deaths: 53,010.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_1351">About 75% of patients with CRC have

(3.9%) among the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460150" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">first-degree relatives</GlossaryTermRef> (FDRs) of patients who had died from
CRC than among sex-matched and age-matched controls (1.2%).<Reference refidx="21"/>  This
difference has since been replicated in numerous studies that have consistently
found that FDRs of affected cases are themselves at a twofold to
threefold increased risk of CRC.  Despite the various study
designs (case-control, cohort), sampling frames, sample sizes, methods of data
verification, analytic methods, and countries where the studies originated, the
magnitude of risk is consistent.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>
</Para><Para id="_786">A systematic review and meta-analysis of familial CRC risk has been reported.<Reference refidx="28"/> Of 24 studies included in the analysis, all but one reported an increased risk of CRC if there was an affected FDR. The relative risk (RR) for CRC in the pooled study was 2.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00–2.53) if there was an affected FDR.  In 8 of 11 studies, if the index cancer arose in the colon, the risk was slightly higher than if it arose in the rectum. The pooled analysis revealed an  RR in relatives of colon and rectal cancer patients of 2.42 (95% CI, 2.20–2.65) and 1.89 (95% CI, 1.62–2.21), respectively. The analysis did not reveal a difference in RR for colon cancer based on location of the tumor (right side vs. left side).</Para><Para id="_787">The number of affected family members and age at cancer diagnosis correlated with the CRC risk. In studies reporting more than one FDR with CRC, the RR was 3.76 (95% CI, 2.56–5.51).  The highest RR was observed when the index case was diagnosed  in individuals younger than 45 years (RR, 3.87; 95% CI, 2.40–6.22) compared with family members of index cases diagnosed at ages 45 to 59 years (RR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.85–2.72), and to family members of index cases diagnosed at age 60  years or older (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.47–2.25). In this meta-analysis, the familial risk of CRC associated with adenoma in an FDR was analyzed. The pooled analysis demonstrated an RR for CRC of 1.99 (95% CI, 1.55–2.55) in individuals who had an FDR with an adenoma.<Reference refidx="28"/> This finding has been corroborated.<Reference refidx="29"/> Other studies have reported that age at diagnosis of the adenoma influences the CRC risk, with younger age at adenoma diagnosis associated with higher RR.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/>  As with any meta-analysis, there could be potential biases that might affect the results of the analysis, including incomplete and nonrandom ascertainment of studies included; publication bias; and heterogeneity between studies relative to design, target populations, and control selection. This study is reinforcement that there are significant associations between familial CRC risk, age at diagnosis of both CRC and adenomas, and multiplicity of affected family members.</Para><Table id="_326"><Title>Table 1.

Colonoscopy is the screening tool of choice for individuals with FAP for the following reasons: (a) improved instrumentation for full colonoscopy, (b) sedation, (c) recognition of AFAP, in which the disease typically manifests in the right colon, and (d) the growing tendency to defer surgery for a number of years.<Reference refidx="123"/>   The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends that individuals who test negative for a known familial <GeneName>APC</GeneName> pathogenic variant  undergo average-risk population screening.

Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) after submucosal injection of saline, with or without epinephrine and/or dye, such as indigo carmine, can be employed for nonampullary lesions.  Ampullary lesions require even greater care including endoscopic ultrasound evaluation for evidence of bile or pancreatic duct involvement.  Stenting of the pancreatic duct is commonly performed to prevent stricturing and pancreatitis.  The stents require endoscopic removal at an interval of 1 to 4 weeks.  Because the ampulla is tethered at the ductal orifices, it typically does not uniformly lift with injection, so injection is commonly not used.  Any consideration of EMR or ampullectomy requires great experience and judgment, with careful consideration of the natural history of untreated lesions and an appreciation of the high rate of adenoma recurrence despite aggressive endoscopic intervention.<Reference refidx="82"/><Reference refidx="180"/><Reference refidx="181"/><Reference refidx="186"/><Reference refidx="191"/><Reference refidx="192"/><Reference refidx="193"/><Reference refidx="194"/> The literature uniformly supports duodenectomy for Spigelman stage  IV disease.

The median age at duodenal adenoma detection was 50 years, and in 65% of patients, duodenal adenomas were diagnosed at baseline endoscopy. Eighty-four percent of patients had Spiegelman stage I or stage II polyposis at first detection of polyps, with no patients with stage IV polyposis and no high-grade dysplasia detected.

No cancers were detected in patients enrolled in upper GI surveillance programs within these registries.  Two individuals with MAP were diagnosed with ampullary and duodenal cancer respectively at ages 83 and 63  years at the time of first-ever upper GI endoscopies.

Lynch syndrome–associated cancers exhibit MSI; therefore, tumor testing is a key component in the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome, in addition to family history. Universal tumor testing of all CRCs is now recommended as a strategy to screen for Lynch syndrome and identify those individuals who may subsequently benefit from germline genetic testing. Intensive cancer screening and surveillance strategies, including frequent colonoscopy, along with risk-reducing surgeries, are mainstays in patients with Lynch syndrome. </Para><SummarySection id="_1096"><Title>History of Lynch syndrome</Title><Para id="_1097">Between 1913 and 1993, numerous case reports of families with apparent increases in CRC were reported.  As series of such reports accumulated, certain characteristic clinical features emerged: early age at onset of CRC; high risk of synchronous (and metachronous) colorectal tumors; preferential involvement of the right colon; improved clinical outcome; and a range of associated extracolonic sites including the endometrium, ovaries, other sites in the  GI tract, uroepithelium, brain, and skin (sebaceous tumors).  Terms such as <Strong>cancer family syndrome</Strong> and <Strong>hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</Strong> (<Strong>HNPCC</Strong>) were used to describe this entity.<Reference refidx="247"/></Para><Para id="_3079">The term <Strong>Lynch syndrome</Strong> replaced HNPCC and is applied to cases in which the genetic basis can be confidently linked to a germline pathogenic variant in a DNA MMR gene.

The <GeneName>APC</GeneName> gene was one of several genes (along with <GeneName>DCC</GeneName> and <GeneName>MCC</GeneName>) evaluated in families that fulfilled Amsterdam criteria, but no linkage was found among the Lynch kindreds.  In 1993, an extended genome-wide search resulted in the recognition of a candidate chromosome 2 susceptibility locus in large families.  Once <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName>, the first Lynch syndrome–associated gene, was sequenced, it was evident from the somatic variant patterns in the CRC tumors that the MMR family of genes was likely involved. Additional MMR genes were subsequently linked to Lynch syndrome, including <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName>, <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName>, and <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName>.

MMRpro’s predictions account for family size and unaffected relatives, the possibility of including molecular tumor data in the risk analysis, and the option of predicting pathogenic variant carrier status following germline testing. The major limitation in the widespread use of MMRpro in routine practice is the need to input data from the entire pedigree (including individuals without cancer), which is relatively time-consuming. Its best use is likely to be as a genetic counseling tool in a specialized high-risk clinic or research setting, as its accessibility is also limited. PREMM’s major advantages include that it is easy to use, available as an online tool, and has been extensively validated, including in a self-administered setting in a GI clinic.<Reference refidx="273"/> It includes risk prediction based on personal and family cancer history up to SDRs for a broad spectrum of extracolonic cancers. However, the model does not consider family size and may overestimate the likelihood of a pathogenic variant in a pedigree that includes multiple elderly family members who are unaffected by CRC or endometrial cancer. Given the ease with which one can use the PREMM model (it has been deemed less time-consuming than MMRpro in validation studies),<Reference refidx="268"/> it may be used by diverse health care providers whose primary aim is to identify patients who should be referred for genetic evaluation, and is likely to be most useful in the pretesting decision-making process. MMRpredict’s use may be limited overall because of its less accurate risk estimates <Reference refidx="274"/> when used to evaluate families with Lynch syndrome–associated cancers and older individuals affected by CRC; the model was developed using data from young-onset CRC cases (patients diagnosed at age &lt;55 y) and did not include extracolonic malignancies. Furthermore, the model does not incorporate tumor testing results or provide post-hoc risk estimates based on gene sequencing results. Lastly, PREMMplus assesses the likelihood of finding a pathogenic variant on a multigene panel of 19 high- and moderate-penetrance genes, and it is not limited to genes associated with CRC.<Reference refidx="262"/></Para><Para id="_3058">Overall, there is ample evidence that each of the models has superior performance characteristics of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values that support their use when compared with the existing clinical guidelines for diagnosis and evaluation of Lynch syndrome. Because of the diverse clinical settings in which a health care provider could assess an individual for Lynch syndrome,  prediction models offer a potentially feasible and useful strategy to systematically identify at-risk individuals, whether or not they are affected with CRC.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2962"><Title>Summary</Title><Para id="_2813">In conclusion, the presence of tumor MSI in CRCs, along with a compelling personal and family history of cancer, warrants germline genetic testing for Lynch syndrome, and most clinical practice guidelines provide for such an approach.

A 2011 survey of the National Society of Genetic Counselors revealed that more than 25% of respondents had some form of universal screening implemented at their center. Tumor screening methods varied; 34 (64.2%) of 53 centers started with IHC, 11 (20.8%) of 53 centers started with MSI testing, and 8 (15.1%) of 53 centers performed both tests on newly diagnosed colorectal tumors.<Reference refidx="330"/> A 2012 survey suggested that some form of universal screening was being routinely performed at 71% of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Comprehensive Cancer Centers, but utilization dropped to 15% among a random sample of community hospital cancer programs.<Reference refidx="331"/></Para><Para id="_2955">Because adherence to universal screening for Lynch syndrome may be poor (many patients are not referred for genetic evaluation and testing), a prospective quality improvement study utilizing the Six Sigma conceptual framework was conducted to improve the implementation of universal genetic screening among young patients with CRC.<Reference refidx="332"/> The main aim of the study was to increase the proportion of tumor studies for deficient MMR among patients with early-onset CRC (aged 18–50 y). The intervention involved patient and provider education, in addition to visual cues provided at point of care. The study demonstrated an improvement of 21.5% in the rate of IHC testing in young adults with CRC over the 12-month postintervention period compared with the preintervention period.</Para><Para id="_2871">Studies reporting uptake of genetic testing for Lynch syndrome have largely focused on individuals and families who were selected for potential risk of Lynch syndrome based on family history or clinical characteristics. While universal tumor screening is increasingly being adopted to identify newly diagnosed patients who may have a germline variant, few studies have examined the uptake of genetic testing after universal tumor testing. An important implication of universal screening for Lynch syndrome is that it does not result in automatic germline testing in appropriate individuals. In the clinical setting, more follow-up by health care teams to facilitate referral to genetic counseling for patients with abnormal tumor screening results may improve completion of genetic testing.<Reference refidx="333"/>  Higher levels of patient completion of genetic testing after abnormal tumor screening may be associated with having genetic counselors involved in this process to disclose screen-positive results, provide counseling after tumor testing, or facilitate referrals.<Reference refidx="334"/></Para><Para id="_2667">Subsequent genetic counseling requires coordination between the pathologist, the referring surgeon or oncologist, and a cancer genetics service. As an illustration, a population-based screening study found that only 54% of patients with an IHC-deficient tumor (that was <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> pathogenic variant negative) ultimately consented to and proceeded with germline MMR testing.<Reference refidx="335"/> One institution found 21 pathogenic variants among 1,100 patients who underwent routine MSI and IHC testing after a diagnosis of CRC.

Women fulfilling Amsterdam II criteria or those diagnosed before age 50 years with at least one FDR with any Lynch syndrome–associated cancer  were directly referred for genetic counseling and genetic testing without IHC testing.

These results may potentially be used to screen for Lynch syndrome in tumors other than CRC.  A study evaluated MSI across a wide variety of malignancies and evaluated its use as a potential means to identify Lynch syndrome, regardless of tumor type.<Reference refidx="341"/>  In a study of more than 15,000 patients with more than 50 types of cancers evaluated in a single-center study, data on well-annotated tumor and matched normal DNA sequencing results with paired germline MMR gene testing, were used to determine MSI status. MSI was determined using a software tool that reports the percentage of unstable microsatellites as a score from paired tumor-normal genome sequencing data and allows for comprehensive investigation of MSI sites simultaneously.  The approach used has been reported to be more sensitive across cancers not typically screened for MMR-deficiency (dMMR) than MSI testing of five mononucleotide microsatellite foci using PCR.<Reference refidx="342"/> CRC and endometrial cancer comprised the majority of cancers with MSI-H in this study, but 38% (125 of 326) of MSI-H tumors and more than 90% of those with intermediate-level MSI were other cancer types. Germline testing confirmed a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome in 16.3% and 1.9% of tumors with MSI-H and intermediate-level MSI, respectively, in addition to 0.3% of cases that lacked MSI. Importantly, half of all Lynch syndrome carriers with MSI-H/intermediate tumors had primary cancers other than CRC or endometrial cancer, with many malignancies not associated with Lynch syndrome. Among those individuals with a noncanonical Lynch syndrome cancer, nearly half failed to meet clinical criteria for Lynch syndrome testing on the basis of their cancer diagnosis or family cancer history. Furthermore, intermediate-level MSI and MSS phenotypes were most often observed in cancers not classically related to Lynch syndrome and in individuals with germline <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName> variants.  This study supports other findings related to the variable phenotypic expression of Lynch syndrome on the basis of the altered MMR gene and its broad constellation of associated malignancies that make it difficult to be identified by clinical criteria alone.  
In addition, the investigators further analyzed a unique gene variant signature in every tumor and correlated results to the observed MSI phenotype and germline MMR status to provide some indirect data on whether a gene variant carrier’s cancer was caused by Lynch syndrome and MMR deficiency or possibly an incidental finding. This is pertinent in evaluating those cancers whose association with Lynch syndrome is unclear and debatable, such as breast and prostate cancer. The authors’ finding that none of the breast cancer patients with Lynch syndrome in this very large cohort had tumors with MSI lends support to the hypothesis that these individuals’ germline MMR gene variants may simply be incidental findings and not etiologic to their cancer diagnosis.

This approach has become less expensive with the advent of multigene (panel) testing, which is now offered by several clinical laboratories at a cost that may be comparable to single-gene testing. The cost of multigene testing may also approach the cost of tumor screening and may prove to be a cost-effective approach in individuals affected by CRC. At present, multigene tests are not routinely recommended for universal screening for Lynch syndrome among all newly diagnosed CRC patients, but they may be very useful in select populations, such as those with early-onset CRC <Reference refidx="344"/> or from familial, high-risk clinic-based populations. It is also important to note that pathogenic variants may be detected in other cancer-associated genes beyond Lynch syndrome. In a study of 1,112 individuals who met NCCN criteria for Lynch syndrome testing and who underwent multigene testing with a 25-gene panel, as expected, 114 individuals (9.0%) were found to have pathogenic variants in MMR genes; however, 71 individuals (5.6%) were found to have a pathogenic variant in non-Lynch syndrome cancer predisposition genes, such as <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>, <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, <GeneName>APC</GeneName>, <GeneName>MUTYH</GeneName> (biallelic), and <GeneName>STK11</GeneName>.

The majority of carriers were affected by cancer, including non-Lynch syndrome–associated malignancies, where breast cancer was most frequently reported (124/423, 23.5%).  <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName> variants were most prevalent (29.3%), followed by <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName> (24.2%), <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> (23.7%), <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName> (21.6%), and <GeneName>EPCAM</GeneName> (1.2%).

A comparable retrospective study reported similar findings. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of breast cancer were calculated by comparing observed breast cancer frequencies in a population of 423 women with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in MMR genes with those in the general population.

Lastly, there were limited data on tumor testing results, available only on 18.8% of pathogenic variant carriers, where results were often discordant with the altered gene, which was most often reported in <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName> and <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName> carriers.

Nearly 80,000 individuals were included in the study.  The number of patients with <GeneName>EPCAM</GeneName> pathogenic variants was insufficient to include in the analysis. Therefore, only families with <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName>, <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName>, <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName> and <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName> pathogenic variants were included.  Patients were clustered by continent (North America, Europe, and Australasia).  There was strong evidence  that  unknown familial risk factors modified CRC risk for Lynch syndrome carriers across all continents. This resulted in wide variation in CRC risk for each MMR gene. This variation was most pronounced for <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName> and <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName>, in which 7% to 56% of carriers had a CRC penetrance of less than 20%, 9% to 44% of carriers had a CRC penetrance of more than 80%, and only 10% to 19% of carriers had a CRC penetrance of 40% to 60%.  Wide variation in CRC risk was observed even when the analysis was restricted to the 250 families carrying the most common variant in the dataset (the  <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> pathogenic c.942+3A&gt;T variant). In this <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> cohort,  9% to 15% of carriers had a CRC penetrance of less than 20%, and  33% to 45% of carriers had a CRC penetrance of more than 80%. Limitations of the study included the following: (1) 94% of patients were ascertained from high-risk clinics, (2) there were limited data on screening and polypectomy, and (3)  multiple assumptions and models were used. These results suggest that published mean cancer risks may not be representative for most Lynch syndrome carriers. Therefore, the authors suggested that current screening guidelines might not be applicable to large proportions of Lynch syndrome patients. Until additional studies have identified and characterized genetic and environmental risk modifiers, contemporary guidelines are recommended for most Lynch syndrome carriers. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_3105"><Title>CMMRD</Title><Para id="_2804">As described above, patients may carry MMR gene variants in both parental alleles, in a condition known as CMMRD.

In the earliest period, information about each individual's variant status was unknown and study participants were eligible based on fulfillment of clinical criteria; the study consisted of some people with a previous cancer or adenoma diagnosis and others without such history who were undergoing asymptomatic screening while the comparison group was composed of individuals from those same families who refused screening. Many of these people (68%) had screening with x-ray contrast/barium enema. Colonoscopy was the approach used for carriers of MMR pathogenic variants when this information was obtainable and the interval between exams was shortened from 5 years to 3 years to 2 years, based on results from the study over time.</Para><Para id="_2994">A 15-year controlled screening trial conducted in this series demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of CRC, CRC-specific mortality, and overall mortality with colonoscopy in individuals from Lynch syndrome families.<Reference refidx="468"/> Colonic screening was provided at 3-year intervals in 133 individuals from Lynch syndrome families and 119 controls from these families had no screening. Among those screened, 8 individuals (6%) developed CRC compared with 19 control subjects (16%), for a risk reduction of 62% with screening. Furthermore, all CRCs in the screened group were local, causing no deaths, while there were 9 deaths caused by CRC in the control group. There was also a benefit in overall mortality in the screened group with 10 deaths in the screened group and 26 deaths in the control group (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .003).</Para><Para id="_3040">The series subsequently limited its attention to subjects without prior diagnosis of adenoma or cancer. The eligible 420 carriers of pathogenic variants had a mean age of 36 years and underwent an average of 2.1 colonoscopies, with a median follow-up of 6.7 years. Adenomas were detected in 28% of subjects. Cumulative risk of one or more adenomas by age 60 years was 68.5% in men and 48.3% in women. Notably, risk of detecting cancer in those free of cancer at baseline exam, and thus regarded as interval cancers, by age 60 years was 34.6% in men and 22.1% in women. The combined cumulative risk of adenoma or cancer by age 60 years was 81.8% in men and 62.9% in women. For both adenomas and carcinomas, about one-half were located proximal to the splenic flexure. While the rates for CRC despite colonoscopy surveillance appear high, the recommended short intervals were not regularly adhered to in this nonrandomized series. These authors recommended surveillance at 2-year intervals. This is in line with most consensus guidelines (refer to <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_3427" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Table 13</SummaryRef>), in which the appropriate colonoscopy screening interval remains every 1 to 2 years. Analysis of colonoscopic surveillance data in 242 carriers of pathogenic variants 10 years after testing shows 95% compliance in surveillance procedures for CRC and endometrial cancer. Although not all CRCs were prevented, mortality was comparable with variant-negative relatives.

Endometrial sampling is performed to provide a histological specimen for diagnosis. Eighty percent of women with endometrial cancer present with stage I disease, and there are no data to suggest that the clinical presentation in women with Lynch syndrome differs from that in the general population.</Para><Para id="_3041">Given their substantial increased risk of endometrial cancer, endometrial cancer screening has been suggested for women  with Lynch syndrome who have not had risk-reducing hysterectomies. Proposed screening methods include transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) (not recommended in premenopausal patients) and/or endometrial biopsy. However, current  NCCN guidelines suggest that  these screening methods may not benefit women with  Lynch syndrome. Screening via endometrial biopsy can be considered in patients with Lynch syndrome, due to its high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Screening may begin at age 30 to 35 years and can be repeated every 1 to 2 years. TVUS, on the other hand, is not sensitive or specific at detecting endometrial cancer. However, this screening method can be considered in women with Lynch syndrome based on a provider's judgment.<Reference refidx="123"/></Para><Para id="_3467">Two studies have examined the use of TVUS in endometrial screening for women with Lynch syndrome.<Reference refidx="482"/><Reference refidx="483"/>  In one study of 292 women from Lynch syndrome families or "Lynch syndrome-like/HNPCC-like" families,  TVUS did not detect any endometrial cancer cases. However, two interval cancers developed in symptomatic women.<Reference refidx="482"/> In a second study, 41 women with Lynch syndrome were enrolled in a TVUS screening program. Of 179 TVUS procedures performed,  17 scans were abnormal. Three of the 17 women with abnormal scans had complex atypical hyperplasia on endometrial sampling, while 14  had normal endometrial sampling. However, TVUS failed to identify one patient who presented with abnormal bleeding 8 months after a normal TVUS was performed; this patient was diagnosed with stage IB endometrial cancer.<Reference refidx="483"/>  Both of these studies concluded that TVUS is neither sensitive nor specific.</Para><Para id="_282">A study of 175 women with Lynch syndrome,  which included both endometrial sampling and TVUS, showed that endometrial sampling improved sensitivity when compared with TVUS. Endometrial sampling found 11 of the 14 cases of endometrial cancer. Two of these cases were interval cancers that developed in symptomatic women, and one case was an occult endometrial cancer found at the time of  hysterectomy.  Endometrial sampling also identified 14 additional cases of endometrial hyperplasia. Among the group of 14 women with endometrial cancer, ten also had  TVUS screening with endometrial sampling.

Initial CAPP2 trial results for 746 Lynch syndrome patients enrolled in the study were published in 2008 <Reference refidx="493"/> and failed to show a significant preventive effect on incident colonic adenomas or carcinomas (relative risk, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7–1.4) with a short-term follow-up (mean, 29 months; range, 7–74 months). In 2011 (mean follow-up, 55.7 months), subsequent data were published on 861 individuals randomly assigned to receive aspirin versus aspirin-placebo, which demonstrated that participants who completed at least 2 years of aspirin (per-protocol analysis) had significantly fewer incident CRCs than individuals randomly assigned to receive  aspirin-placebo (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19–0.86, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .02; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18–0.78, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .008), although there was no significant difference by intention-to-treat analysis (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.35–1.13, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .12).<Reference refidx="492"/> </Para><Para id="_3408">In 2020, long-term follow-up data with all participants having surpassed 10 years of follow-up demonstrated a significant reduction in CRC incidence for participants randomly assigned to receive  aspirin both by per-protocol analysis (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34–0.91) and intention-to-treat analysis (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43–0.97).<Reference refidx="494"/> These long-term data showed that the protective effects of aspirin did not emerge until approximately 5 years after initiation of aspirin and, intriguingly, the protective effects of aspirin (taken in this study for only a finite period of time, although the data on aspirin use post unblinding do not exist) persisted to at least 20 years of follow-up. These data demonstrated that only 24 Lynch syndrome carriers needed to be treated with this finite course of aspirin to prevent one incident CRC. Female CAPP2 participants randomly assigned to receive  aspirin versus aspirin-placebo also developed fewer incident endometrial cancers (7 vs. 17 cases), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.22–1.11, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .09). There was no significant difference seen in the incidence of cancers other than CRC and endometrial cancer in individuals randomly assigned to receive  aspirin versus aspirin-placebo. There were no significant differences in adverse events between the aspirin and placebo groups, and no serious adverse effects were noted with any treatment.<Reference refidx="492"/> The CAPP2 investigators concluded that aspirin 600 mg/day has a clear benefit for protecting against CRC in individuals with Lynch syndrome. A key limitation of the CAPP2 trial is that the frequency of surveillance studies at the various centers was not reported as being standardized.</Para><Para id="_3409">To date, there has been no significant preventive benefit identified in CAPP2 participants randomly assigned to receive resistant starch versus starch-placebo (HR for incident CRC, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.62–1.34; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .63).<Reference refidx="495"/> However, at a planned 10-year follow-up, participants who had been randomized to receive resistant starch had significantly fewer non-CRC Lynch syndrome cancers  than patients who received starch-placebo (IRR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32–0.84; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .0075). This difference seems to have been driven by reduced  rates of incident upper-GI tract cancers (gastric, pancreas, biliary, and small bowel cancers).There were 5 upper-GI cancers in participants randomized to take resistant starch and 21 upper-GI cancers in those randomized to take starch-placebo. The biological mechanisms that led to reduced upper-GI tract cancer incidence in Lynch syndrome patients who took resistant starch remain speculative.

The incidence of metachronous CRCs has been reported to be 16% at 10 years, 41% at 20 years, and 63% at 30 years after segmental colectomy.<Reference refidx="407"/> Because of the increased incidence of synchronous and metachronous neoplasms, the recommended surgical treatment for a patient with Lynch syndrome with neoplastic colonic lesions is generally an extended colectomy (total or subtotal). Nevertheless, treatment has to be individualized and has often included segmental colectomy. Mathematical models suggest that there are minimal benefits of extended procedures in individuals older than 67 years, compared with  the benefits seen in younger individuals with early-onset cancer. In one Markov decision analysis model, the survival advantage for a young individual with early-onset CRC undergoing an extended procedure could be up to 4 years longer than that seen in the same individual undergoing a segmental resection.<Reference refidx="501"/> The recommendation for an extended procedure must be balanced with the comorbidities of the patient, the clinical stage of the disease, the wishes of the patient, and surgical expertise.

Although MSI testing was initially used  to screen  patients who might harbor pathogenic MMR gene variants, it has been increasingly recognized that MSI has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. The utility of MSI testing beyond identifying Lynch syndrome has made the case for universal MSI screening more compelling and has contributed to its widespread adoption. Several studies have suggested that stage-specific survival is better for MSI-H CRC compared with MSS cancers. Additionally, the chemotherapeutic agent fluorouracil (5-FU) appears ineffective in the adjuvant treatment of resected MSI-H CRC, in contrast to MSS CRC in which this agent is widely utilized for this purpose. Finally, immunomodulation with agents such as checkpoint inhibitors appears effective in the treatment of advanced MSI-H CRC based on early phase 1 and phase 2 studies, while these agents, at least when utilized as monotherapy, show little activity in MSS CRC.</Para><SummarySection id="_3067"><Title>Prognosis of MSI</Title><Para id="_3068">Although MSI-H tumors account for 15% of all sporadic CRC, they appear to be more frequent in stage II  compared with stage III CRC,<Reference refidx="514"/> and are even less common in metastatic disease, being present in only 3% to 4% of metastatic cases.<Reference refidx="515"/> This stage distinction alludes to the possibility of a better prognosis associated with underlying MSI-H status.</Para><Para id="_3069">Several studies subsequently confirmed the improved survival of stage II MSI-H CRC compared with MSS cases. A meta-analysis of 32 studies of 7,642 cases, including 1,277 with MSI-H, showed a combined HR estimate for overall survival (OS) associated with MSI of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.59–0.71; heterogeneity <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .16; I<Superscript>2</Superscript> [a measure of the percentage of variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance]  = 20%).<Reference refidx="516"/> However, while data were limited, tumors with MSI derived no benefit from adjuvant 5-FU (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.72–2.14). Subsequent data from several large randomized clinical trials confirmed the favorable prognosis associated with MSI-H. These included the QUick And Simple And Reliable (QUASAR) trial, which explored the benefit of adjuvant 5-FU–based chemotherapy compared with surgery alone in 1,900 patients with resected stage II CRC. In this study, MSI-H tumors were associated with a recurrence risk of half that of MSS tumors (risk ratio [RR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40–0.70).<Reference refidx="517"/> Similar results were seen in the Pan European Trial Adjuvant Colon Cancer (PETACC)-3 trial, a randomized trial of 5-FU with or without irinotecan in resected stage II or stage III CRC.<Reference refidx="518"/> MSI-H status was associated with an OS odds ratio (OR) of 0.39 (95% CI, 0.24–0.65) and this advantage was seen in both stage  II and stage III disease.</Para><Para id="_3243">Consistent with other prior data, clinicopathologic analysis of 85 Lynch syndrome–associated CRCs and 67 sporadic dMMR CRCs demonstrated a significantly superior survival among patients with Lynch syndrome, as well as younger ages at diagnosis and higher numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).<Reference refidx="519"/> Exome sequencing and neoantigen data from a subset of 16 CRC tumors (eight Lynch syndrome CRCs and eight sporadic dMMR CRCs) from this cohort suggest that somatic mutational burden and neoantigen load is significantly higher among Lynch syndrome–associated CRCs than sporadic dMMR CRCs; this was speculated to be the source of the improved survival outcomes and increased TILs.</Para><Para id="_3070">Given the predilection for MSI-H tumors to involve the right side of the colon, there is a paucity of data on the outcome and prognosis of MSI-H tumors involving the rectum.

The 5-year rectal cancer–specific survival was 100% for stage I and stage II, 85.1% for stage III, and 60.0% for stage IV disease, suggesting the favorable prognosis associated with MSI-H may also apply to cancers involving the rectum.<Reference refidx="506"/> The authors additionally reported a favorable 26% pathological complete response rate with 5-FU combined with radiation therapy, suggesting that 5-FU given with radiation for the locoregional treatment of rectal cancer may still be effective in the setting of MSI-H tumors.

Several studies have shown that the improved mucosal contrast achieved with the use of indigo carmine can improve the adenoma detection rate.

The RR of small bowel malignancy is very high in Lynch syndrome, but absolute risk is less than 10%.  Although the risks of small bowel neoplasia are high enough to warrant consideration of surveillance in each disease, the technical challenges of doing so have been daunting. Because of the technical challenges and relatively low prevalences, there is virtually no evidence base for small-bowel screening in Lynch syndrome.</Para><Para id="_1378">Historically, the relative endoscopic inaccessibility of the mid and distal small bowel required radiographic measures for its evaluation, including the barium small bowel series or a variant called tube enteroclysis, in which a nasogastroduodenal tube is placed so that all of the contrast goes into the small intestine  quickly and undiluted by gastric juice for more precise imaging.  None of these measures were sensitive for small lesions. Previously, therapeutic removal of lesions required laparotomy. However, multiple novel endoscopic approaches have been developed to overcome the technical limitations of small bowel endoscopy, which has enabled jejunal and ileal access for purposes of polypectomy. </Para><Para id="_1379">For patients with PJS, double-balloon endoscopy or other forms of deep enteroscopy (single-balloon overtube or spiral overtube) are the preferred  methods for evaluation of the small bowel.<Reference refidx="652"/>  This may involve either peroral enteroscopy or retrograde enteroscopy to achieve more complete evaluation of the small bowel.  Because these procedures are time-consuming and involve risks of complication, deep enteroscopy is usually preceded by more imaging, including barium exams, capsule endoscopy, CT or magnetic resonance enterography.<Reference refidx="73"/></Para><Para id="_1380">In FAP, data from capsule endoscopy <Reference refidx="73"/> show a 50% to 100% prevalence of jejunal and/or ileal polyps in patients with Spigelman stage III or stage IV duodenal involvement but virtually no such polyps in Spigelman stage I or stage II disease.  Polyps smaller than 10 mm and were not biopsied or removed.  Consequently, their clinical significance remains uncertain but is likely limited, given the infrequency of jejunoileal cancer reports in FAP.</Para><Para id="_1381">Capsule endoscopy in the small series of PJS patients described above <Reference refidx="73"/> showed the presence of a similar frequency (50%–100%) of polyps, but the prevalent polyps were much larger than in FAP, were more likely to become symptomatic, and warranted endoscopic or surgical excision.

Clinical practice relies less solely on family history to identify individuals who may benefit from testing, and instead utilizes universal molecular diagnostic testing of CRC and endometrial cancer tumors in newly diagnosed patients using <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285933" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">MSI</GlossaryTermRef> and/or IHC as an initial screen for Lynch syndrome.

Two reports from a single institution found that 20% and 13% of CRC and endometrial cancer index cases, respectively, with abnormal IHC results followed through with germline variant testing for Lynch syndrome.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/> These studies did not solicit reasons for follow through with genetic counseling and testing.

A small (n = 19) qualitative study of newly diagnosed patients with CRC who met high-risk criteria for referral to cancer genetics risk assessment and counseling identified potential reasons why patients may not seek counseling as recommended. These reasons included incomplete knowledge of family cancer history and not realizing the relevance of family history to their personal cancer diagnosis; lack of a specific, direct physician’s recommendation for counseling; and viewing counseling as a lower priority than coping with the immediate demands of a new cancer diagnosis.<Reference refidx="15"/>  In a follow-up survey of 91 individuals in a randomized trial to promote colonoscopy screening in those at risk for Lynch syndrome, only 24% reported ever having discussed genetic testing with their physicians, and the most common barrier to undergoing testing was lack of advice to do so by a health care provider.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_3182"><Title>Uptake of cascade screening by at-risk relatives</Title><Para id="_3183">There is increasing adoption of universal screening of newly diagnosed tumors for Lynch syndrome in clinical practice.

Data from a longitudinal study including 134 carriers of MMR pathogenic variants with and without a prior Lynch syndrome–related cancer diagnosis found that those who did not undergo colonoscopy for surveillance within 6 months after receiving genetic test results were six times more likely to report clinically significant depressive symptoms as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression
 (CES-D) scale (odds ratio [OR], 6.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09–17.59).  Higher levels of CRC worry measured before genetic testing also were associated with clinically significant depressive symptoms (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.19–1.97).<Reference refidx="39"/></Para><Para id="_556">Two studies examined the level of adherence to published screening guidelines after Lynch syndrome genetic testing, based on variant status. One study reported a colonoscopy adherence rate of 100% among carriers of pathogenic variants.<Reference refidx="23"/>  Another study found that 35% of carriers and 13% of noncarriers did not adhere to published guidelines for appropriate CRC screening;<Reference refidx="35"/> in both groups, about one-half screened more frequently than published guidelines recommend, and one-half screened less frequently. </Para><Para id="_557">The longitudinal studies described above examined colorectal screening behavior within a relatively short period of time (1 year) after receiving genetic test results, and less is known about longer-term use of screening behaviors.  A longitudinal study (N = 73) that examined psychological and behavioral outcomes among cancer-unaffected 
individuals at 3 years after disclosure of genetic test results found that all carriers (n = 19) had undergone at least one colonoscopy between 1 and 3 years postdisclosure.<Reference refidx="20"/> A longitudinal study of similar outcomes up to 7 years posttesting also found that all carriers had undergone colonoscopy; most (83%) underwent the procedure every 3 years or more frequently as recommended, and 11% reported longer screening intervals.<Reference refidx="32"/>  In this study, those who reported longer screening intervals than recommended also were more likely to report a fear of dying soon. Also, 16% of noncarriers reported undergoing colonoscopy within the 7 years posttesting; those who indicated doubts about the validity of their test result were more likely to have had a colonoscopy.<Reference refidx="32"/> Ninety-four percent of carriers in one study stated an intention to have annual or biannual colonoscopy in the future; among noncarriers, 64% did not intend to have colonoscopy in the future or were unsure, and 33% intended to have colonoscopy 
at 5- to 6-year intervals or less frequently.<Reference refidx="23"/>  A cross-sectional study conducted in the Netherlands examined the use of flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy among individuals with CRC, endometrial cancer, or a clinical or 
genetic diagnosis of Lynch syndrome during a time that ranged from 2 years to 18 years after risk assessment and counseling.<Reference refidx="40"/>  Eighty-six percent of carriers of Lynch syndrome pathogenic variants, 68% of those who did not test or who had an uninformative Lynch syndrome genetic test result, and 73% of those with a clinical Lynch syndrome diagnosis were considered adherent with screening recommendations, based on data obtained from medical records. Participants also answered questions regarding screening adherence, and 16% of the overall sample reported that they had undergone screening less frequently than recommended.  For the overall sample, greater perceived barriers to screening were associated with screening nonadherence as determined through medical record review, and embarrassment with screening procedures was associated with self-reported nonadherence. A second cross-sectional study, also conducted in the Netherlands, surveyed cancer-unaffected carriers of Lynch syndrome variants (n = 42) regarding their colorectal screening behaviors after learning their pathogenic variant status (range, 6 mo–8.5 y). Thirty-one percent of respondents reported that they had undergone annual colonoscopy before Lynch syndrome genetic testing, and 88% reported that they had  undergone colonoscopy since their genetic diagnosis (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001).<Reference refidx="31"/></Para><Para id="_2869">Less is known about Lynch syndrome screening behaviors in individuals who may be at risk of having a germline pathogenic variant but who do not undergo genetic counseling and/or genetic testing to learn about their risk statuses.  Among relatives of carriers of a Lynch syndrome germline pathogenic variant from the Australian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry, 26 who had not undergone genetic counseling and/or testing completed an interview to assess their perceived risk of developing CRC in the next 10 years and to self-report their colonoscopy status.<Reference refidx="41"/>  Their mean perceived risk was 30.5%, which exceeded the mean predicted risk of 4%, as calculated by MMRpro software.<Reference refidx="42"/>  Seventy-three percent (n = 19) reported undergoing a colonoscopy (one for diagnostic reasons); 35% had undergone colonoscopy within the past 2 years and had adhered to CRC screening recommendations.  Perceived risk was slightly and positively correlated with years since an individual's last colonoscopy (Pearson's <Emphasis>r</Emphasis>,  0.49; range,  0.02–0.79) but otherwise was not associated with other screening or personal characteristics.  The authors concluded that perceived CRC risk alone may not be a sufficient predictor of colonoscopy use in relatives of Lynch syndrome pathogenic variant carriers who have not undergone genetic counseling and/or testing.<Reference refidx="41"/> Another study compared colonoscopy screening rates and predictors  of CRC screening participation in two different populations: (1)  people diagnosed with Lynch syndrome (n = 59), and (2) people  at risk for Lynch syndrome who did not have genetic  testing (n = 47). Individuals without genetic testing had   lower colonoscopy participation rates than those with a Lynch syndrome pathogenic variant (47% vs. 73%, respectively). Perceived CRC risk and physician recommendation for CRC screening  were important predictors of colonoscopy screening adherence, independent of an individual's genetic testing status.<Reference refidx="43"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_558"><Title>Gynecologic cancer screening for Lynch syndrome</Title><Para id="_559">Several small studies have examined the use of screening for endometrial and ovarian cancers associated with Lynch syndrome (refer to <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_2665" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Table 16</SummaryRef>).

It is generally accepted that communication about genetic risk information within families is largely the responsibility of family members themselves.  A few studies have examined communication patterns in families who had been offered Lynch syndrome genetic counseling and testing.  Studies have focused on whether individuals disclosed information about Lynch syndrome genetic testing to their family members, to whom they disclosed this information, and family-based characteristics or issues that might facilitate or inhibit such communication. These studies examined communication and disclosure processes in families after notification by health care professionals about a Lynch syndrome predisposition and have comprised relatively small samples.</Para><Para id="_707">Research findings indicate that individuals are generally  willing to share information about the presence of a Lynch syndrome pathogenic variant within their families.<Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/> Motivations for sharing genetic risk information include a desire to increase family awareness about personal risk, health promotion options and predictive genetic testing, a desire for emotional support, and a perceived moral obligation and responsibility to help others in the family.<Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/>  Findings across studies suggest that most study participants believed that Lynch syndrome genetic risk information is shared openly within families; however, such communication is more likely to occur with FDRs (e.g., siblings, children) than with more distant relatives.<Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/>  </Para><Para id="_1284">One Finnish study recruited parents aged 40 years or older and known to carry an MMR pathogenic variant to complete a questionnaire that  investigated how parents shared knowledge of genetic risk with their adult and minor offspring.

Reasons for nondisclosure were consistent with previous studies (young age of offspring, socially distant relationships, or feelings of difficulty in discussing the topic).<Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="51"/> Nearly all parents had informed their adult offspring about their genetic risk and the possibility of genetic testing, but nearly one-third were unsure of how their offspring had used the information. Parents identified discussing their children’s cancer risk as the most difficult aspect of the communication process. Of the 191 firstborn children informed, 69% had undergone genetic testing.

A desire to not worry relatives with information about test results and  the perception that relatives would not understand the meaning of this information also have been cited as communication barriers.<Reference refidx="49"/>  Disclosure seemed less likely if at-risk individuals were considered too young to receive the information (i.e., children), if information about the hereditary cancer risk had previously created conflict in the family,<Reference refidx="48"/> or if it was assumed that relatives would be uninterested in information about testing.<Reference refidx="47"/>  Prior existence of conflict seemed to inhibit discussions about hereditary cancer risk, particularly if such discussions involved disclosure of bad news.<Reference refidx="48"/></Para><Para id="_709">For most participants in these studies, the news that the pattern of cancers in their families was attributable to a Lynch syndrome–predisposing pathogenic variant did not come as a surprise,<Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/> as individuals had suspected a hereditary cause for the familial cancers or had prior family discussions about cancer.  Identification of a Lynch syndrome–predisposing pathogenic variant in the family was considered a private matter but not necessarily a secret,<Reference refidx="46"/>  and many individuals had discussed the family’s pathogenic variant status with 
someone outside of the family.

Those who encouraged screening were older, female, and significant others or biological family members, rather than nonfamily members.

A small proportion of respondents (16%) reported experiencing some FAP-related discrimination, primarily indicating that attending to their medical or self-care needs (e.g., time off work for screening, need for frequent toilet breaks, and physical limitations) may engender negative attitudes in colleagues and managers.</Para><Para id="_1304">Another large cross-sectional study of FAP families conducted in the Netherlands included individuals aged 16 to 84 years who either had an FAP diagnosis, were at 50% risk of having an <GeneName>APC</GeneName> pathogenic variant, or were proven <GeneName>APC</GeneName> noncarriers.<Reference refidx="63"/>  Of those who had <GeneName>APC</GeneName> testing, 48% had done so at least 5 years or longer before this study.  Of individuals with an FAP diagnosis, 76% had undergone preventive colectomy, and 78% of those were at least 5 years postsurgery.  The study evaluated the prevalence of generalized psychological distress, distress related specifically to FAP, and cancer-related worries.  Mean scores on the Mental Health Index-5, a subscale of the SF-36 that assessed generalized distress, were comparable to the general Dutch population. Twenty percent of respondents were classified as having moderate to high levels of FAP-specific distress as measured by the Impact of Event scale (IES), with 23% of those with an FAP diagnosis, 11% of those at risk of FAP, and 17% of noncarriers reporting scores in this range.  Five percent reported scores on the IES that indicated severe and clinically relevant distress; of those, the majority (78%) had an FAP diagnosis.  Overall, mean scores on the Cancer Worry Scale were comparable to those found in another study of families with Lynch syndrome.  Individuals with an FAP diagnosis were more likely to report more frequent cancer worries, and the most commonly reported worries were the potential need for additional surgery (26%) and the likelihood that they (17%) or a family member (14%) will develop cancer.  In multivariate analysis, factors associated with higher levels of FAP-specific distress included greater perceived risk of developing cancer, more frequent discussion about FAP with family or friends, and having no children.  Factors associated with higher levels of cancer-specific worries included being female, poorer family functioning, greater actual and desired discussion about FAP with family or friends, greater perceived cancer risk, poorer general health perceptions, and having been a caregiver for a family member with cancer. The authors noted that most factors that were associated with higher levels of cancer- and FAP-specific distress or worry were psychosocial factors, rather than clinical or demographic factors. </Para><Para id="_1104">Another cross-sectional study conducted in the Netherlands found that among FAP patients, 37% indicated that the disease had influenced their desire to have children (i.e., wanting fewer or no children).

Higher levels of guilt and more positive attitudes towards terminating pregnancy were associated with greater interest for both PND and PGT.<Reference refidx="58"/> In a separate U.S. study, predictors of willingness to consider prenatal testing included having an affected child and experiencing an FDR’s death secondary to FAP.<Reference refidx="64"/></Para><Para id="_220">The psychological vulnerability of children undergoing testing is of particular concern in genetic testing for FAP.

As in studies involving adults, however, subgroups may be vulnerable to increased distress and would benefit from continued psychological support.  A study of children who had undergone  genetic testing
for FAP found that their mood and behavior remained in the normal range after genetic
counseling and disclosure of test results. Aspects of the family situation, including illness in the mother or a sibling were associated with subclinical increases in depressive symptoms.<Reference refidx="65"/> In a long-term follow-up study of 48 children undergoing testing for FAP, most children did not suffer psychological distress; however,  a small proportion of children tested demonstrated clinically significant posttest distress.<Reference refidx="66"/> Another study found that although <GeneName>APC</GeneName> pathogenic variant–positive children’s perceived risk of developing the disease increased after disclosure of results, anxiety and depression levels remain unchanged in the year after disclosure.<Reference refidx="60"/>  Pathogenic variant–negative children in this study experienced less anxiety and improved self-esteem over this same time period.

One study of a small number of individuals (aged 17–53 y) with a family history of FAP who were offered participation in a genetic counseling and testing protocol found that among those who were asymptomatic, all reported undergoing at least one endoscopic surveillance before participation in the study.<Reference refidx="38"/> Only 33% (two of six patients) reported continuing screening at the recommended interval.  Of the affected individuals who had undergone colectomy, 92% (11 of 12 patients) were adherent to recommended colorectal surveillance. In a cross-sectional study of 150 individuals with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of classic FAP or attenuated FAP (AFAP) and at-risk relatives, 52% of those with FAP and 46% of relatives at risk of FAP, had undergone recommended endoscopic screening.<Reference refidx="67"/>   Among individuals who had or were at risk of AFAP, 58% and 33%, respectively, had undergone screening.  Compared with individuals who had undergone screening within the recommended time interval, those who had not screened were less likely to recall provider recommendations for screening, more likely to lack health insurance or insurance reimbursement for screening, and more likely to believe that they are not at increased risk of CRC.  Only 42% of the study population had ever undergone genetic counseling.  A small percentage of participants (14%–19%) described screening as a “necessary evil,” indicating a dislike for the bowel preparation, or experienced pain and discomfort.  Nineteen percent reported that these issues might pose barriers to undergoing future endoscopies.  Nineteen percent reported that improved techniques and the use of anesthesia have improved tolerance for screening procedures.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2946"><Title>Risk-reducing surgery</Title><Para id="_566">When individuals at risk of FAP develop multiple polyps, risk-reducing surgery in the form of subtotal colectomy or proctocolectomy is the only effective way  to reduce the risk of CRC. Most persons with FAP can avoid a permanent ostomy and preserve the anus and/or rectum, allowing some degree of bowel continence.
