Screening tests can detect prostate cancer at an early stage, but it is not clear whether earlier detection and consequent earlier treatment leads to any change in the natural history and outcome of the disease.   Observational evidence shows a trend toward lower mortality for prostate cancer in some countries, but the relationship between these trends and intensity of screening is not clear, and associations with screening patterns are inconsistent.

It is estimated that in 2025, approximately 313,780
new cases and 35,770 prostate cancer–related deaths will occur in the United
States.                                                                        Prostate cancer is now the second-leading cause of cancer death in
men, after lung cancer.  In males, it accounts for 30% of all cancers and
11% of cancer-related deaths.<Reference refidx="1"/> For 2022, age-adjusted prostate cancer mortality rates per 100,000 were 18.7 overall, 17.9 for White men, and 36.4 for Black men.<Reference refidx="2"/> Age-adjusted incidence rates increased
steadily from 1975 through 1992,  with particularly dramatic increases associated with
the inception of widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the late
1980s and early 1990s, followed by a  fall in incidence. A decline in early-stage prostate cancer incidence rates from 2011 to 2012  (19%) in men aged 50 years and older persisted through 2013 (6%)  in Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registries following the 2012 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations against routine PSA testing of all men. Whether this pattern will lead to an increase in diagnosis of distant-stage disease and prostate cancer mortality is not yet known and will require long-term follow-up.<Reference refidx="3"/> Between 1993 and 2022, mortality rates declined by about 50%. However, between 1993 and 2012, mortality rates decreased from 3.6% per year to 0.5% per year, respectively. This trend may reflect an increase in advanced-stage diagnoses.<Reference refidx="1"/>  It has been suggested
 that declines in mortality rates in certain jurisdictions reflect the
benefit of PSA screening,<Reference refidx="4"/> but others  have noted that these
observations may be explained by independent phenomena such as improved
treatments.<Reference refidx="5"/> The estimated lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis is between 12% and 13%,<Reference refidx="1"/> and the lifetime risk of dying from this disease is 2.0%.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_431">Cancer statistics from the National Cancer
Institute indicated  that between 2014 and 2020,  the proportion of disease diagnosed at a

Rigorous evaluation of any prostate cancer screening modality is desirable because the natural history of the disease is variable, and appropriate treatment is not clearly defined. Although the prevalence of prostate cancer and preneoplastic lesions found at
autopsy steadily increases for each decade of age, most of these lesions remain
clinically undetected.<Reference refidx="1"/>  
 An autopsy study of White and Asian men also found an increase in occult prostate cancer with age, reaching nearly 60% in men older than 80 years. More than 50% of cancers in Asian men and 25% of cancers in White men had a Gleason score of 7 or greater, suggesting that Gleason score may be an imprecise indicator of clinically insignificant prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_435">There is an association between primary tumor volume and
local extent of disease, progression, and survival.<Reference refidx="4"/>  A review of a large
number of prostate cancers in radical prostatectomy, cystectomy, and autopsy
specimens showed that capsular penetration, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph
node metastases were usually found only with tumors larger than 1.4 mL.<Reference refidx="5"/> 
Furthermore, the semiquantitative histopathological grading scheme proposed by
Gleason is reasonably reproducible among pathologists and correlates with the
incidence of nodal metastases and with patient survival in a number of reported
studies.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_436">Pathological stage does not always reflect clinical stage and upstaging (owing

clinically localized stage (T1–2, NX, M0 [T = tumor size, N = lymph node involvement, and M = metastasis]).<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  However, in one series

Numerous studies have also assessed its value as a screening intervention for the early detection of prostate cancer. The potential value of the test appears to be its simplicity, objectivity, reproducibility, relative lack of invasiveness, and relatively low cost. PSA testing has increased the detection rate of early-stage cancers, some of which may be curable by local-modality therapies, and  others that do not require treatment.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> The possibility of identifying an excessive number of false-positive results in the form of benign prostatic lesions requires that the test be evaluated carefully. Furthermore, there is a risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment (i.e., the detection of a histological malignancy that, if left untreated, would have had a benign or indolent natural history and would have been of no clinical significance).  Randomized trials have therefore been conducted.</Para><SummarySection id="_325"><Title>Randomized Trials of PSA Screening</Title><SummarySection id="_326"><Title>The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial</Title><Para id="_327">The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial is a multicenter, randomized, two-armed trial designed to evaluate the effect of screening for prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers on disease-specific mortality. From 1993 through 2001, 76,693 men at ten U.S. study centers were randomly assigned to receive annual screening (38,343 subjects) or usual care (38,350 control subjects). Men in the screening group were offered annual PSA testing for 6 years and digital rectal exam (DRE) for 4 years. The subjects and health care providers received the results and decided on the type of follow-up evaluation. Usual care sometimes included screening, as some organizations have recommended. <Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_328">In the screening group, rates of compliance were 85% for PSA testing and 86% for DRE.

Through registries in seven European countries, investigators identified 182,000 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years for inclusion in the study. Although the protocols differed considerably among countries, generally the men were randomly assigned to either a group that offered PSA screening at an average of once every 4 years or to a control group that did not receive screening. The predefined core age group for this study included 162,243 men between the ages of 55 years and 69 years. The primary outcome was the rate of death from prostate cancer. Mortality follow-up was identical for the two study groups and has been reported through 2010.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_337">The protocol, including recruitment, randomization procedures, and treatment definition and schedule, differed among countries and was developed in accordance with national regulations and standards. In Finland, Sweden, and Italy, the men in the trial were identified from population registries and were randomly assigned to the centers before written informed consent was provided. In the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Spain, the target population was also identified from population lists, but when the men were invited to participate in the trial, only those who provided consent were randomly assigned. Randomization was 1:1 in all countries except Finland, in which it was 1:1.5. The definition of a positive test and the testing schedule  also varied by country.</Para><Para id="_338">In the screening group, 82% of men accepted at least one offer of screening. At a median follow-up of 9 years, there were 5,990 prostate cancers diagnosed in the screening group (a cumulative incidence of 8.2%) and 4,307 prostate cancers in the control group (a cumulative incidence of 4.8%). There were 214 prostate-cancer deaths in the screening group and 326 prostate-cancer deaths in the control group in the core age group (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67–0.95). The rates of death in the two study groups began to diverge after 7 to 8 years and continued to diverge further over time.<Reference refidx="11"/>  With follow-up through 13 years, there were 7,408 prostate cancers in the intervention group during 775,527 person-years of follow-up and 6,107 cancers in the control group with 980,474 person-years of follow-up (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.51–1.62).  There were also 355 prostate cancer deaths over 825,018 person-years of follow-up in the intervention group and 545 deaths over 1,011,192 person-years of follow-up in the control group (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69–0.91). Consequently, 781 men needed to be invited for screening to avert one prostate cancer death, and 48 men needed to be biopsied.<Reference refidx="10"/> At 16 years of follow-up, the prostate cancer mortality rate ratio was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.72–0.89), and the prostate cancer incidence rate ratio was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.36–1.45). Therefore, 570 men needed to be invited to prevent one prostate cancer death, and 18 men needed to be diagnosed to prevent one prostate cancer death.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_339">Overall, PSA-based screening was reported to reduce the rate of death from prostate cancer by about 20% but was associated with a high risk of overdiagnosis.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_507">Of the seven centers included in the study, two individually reported a significant mortality benefit associated with prostate cancer screening (the Netherlands and Sweden). It is not readily apparent which factors at these two centers (PSA thresholds or intervals between testing used, mean age of patients, sample size) might explain the observed difference. It is important to note that the trial was not designed for individual countries to have adequate statistical power to find a significant mortality reduction.</Para><Para id="_340">Important information that was not reported included the contamination rate in the entire control group. Further, there was some evidence that the  treatment administered to the prostate cancer patients differed by stage and by randomly assigned group, with the screening group receiving radical prostatectomy (40.3%) more often than the control group (30.3%). Such a difference in treatment could have contributed to any mortality difference between the trial arms. To address this issue, an analysis was conducted for each treatment, separately in each trial arm, in which logistic regression models were fitted for treatment allocation and risk of prostate cancer death, then combined to estimate prostate cancer deaths. The differences in prostate cancer deaths when the screened arm model was applied to the control arm, and vice versa, were very small, leading the authors to conclude that differential treatment explains only a trivial proportion of the main trial findings.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_549">However, concerns with this analysis include the following:</Para><OrderedList id="_550" Style="Arabic">
     <ListItem>Data from only four of the trial countries were used.</ListItem><ListItem>There was a considerable amount of missing data on clinical M and clinical N stage.</ListItem><ListItem>The risk of prostate cancer death model from the screened arm was used in both comparisons, so that any enhanced survival bias caused by possibly better treatment quality in the screened arm was not accounted for.</ListItem><ListItem>All prostate cancer cases were included in the analysis, with results averaged over all cases.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_551">Most of these cases were early stage, including overdiagnosed cases, for which treatment differences would likely make little difference, and from which only a limited fraction of the prostate cancer deaths arise.

The PSA threshold for biopsy was 2.5 ng/mL. Seventy-seven percent of men in the screened group attended at least one screen. At 18 years of follow-up, 1,396 men in the screened group and 962 in the control group had been diagnosed with prostate cancer (hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.39–1.64).

The trial was designed to determine the effect of the intervention on prostate cancer mortality. The primary end point was definite, probable, or intervention-related prostate cancer mortality at a median follow-up of 10 years. Participants were aged 50 to 69 years at entry and were enrolled between 2001 and 2009, with passive follow-up through national database linkage completed on March 31, 2016. Randomization was stratified within geographical groups and block sizes of 10 to 12 neighboring practices using a computerized random number generator. Men with a positive PSA test diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer were recruited to the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study for treatment. All other cancers received standard National Health Service management. The design called for 209,000 men in each group to provide sufficient events to allow a prostate cancer mortality RR of 0.87 to be detected with 80% power at a significance level of 0.05, assuming an uptake of PSA testing between 35% and 50%.</Para><Para id="_534">Nine hundred-eleven primary care practices were randomly assigned within 99 geographical areas in the United Kingdom; 466 practices were assigned to the intervention group, and 445 were assigned to the control group. After various exclusions among both practices and potential participants, the analyses were conducted using data from 189,386 men in 271 practices in the intervention group and 219,439 men in 302 practices in the control group. In the intervention group, 75,707 (40%) men attended a PSA testing clinic, and 67,313 (36%) men had a PSA blood sample taken. Among these men, 11% of men had a PSA level between 3 ng/mL and 19.9 ng/mL (eligible for the ProtecT trial); of whom, 85% of men had a prostate biopsy. Cumulative contamination in the control group was estimated to be 10% to 15% over 10 years.</Para><Para id="_535">After a median 10-year follow-up, there was no significant difference between the two groups in prostate cancer mortality. The prostate cancer death rates were 0.30 per 1,000 person-years (549 deaths) in the intervention group and 0.31 per 1,000 person-years (647 deaths) in the control group (rate difference, -0.013 per 1,000 person years [95% CI, -0.047 to 0.022]; RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.85–1.08]). Secondary analyses indicated no effect on all-cause mortality (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.94–1.03), but there was a higher prostate cancer incidence rate in the intervention group (4.45 per 1,000 person-years) compared with the control group (3.80 per 1,000 person-years). There was no reduction in advanced prostate cancers (Gleason 8–10 or T4, N1, or M1). The
increased detection was confined to lower Gleason grade or lower-stage cancers, emerged at the beginning of screening, and persisted throughout the duration of follow-up, suggesting overdiagnosis.</Para><Para id="_610">An update to the initial 10-year outcomes reported on four prespecified, secondary, 15-year outcomes (prostate cancer-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, prostate cancer stage, and prostate cancer grade at diagnosis).<Reference refidx="20"/> The 15-year analysis included 98% of men from the initial 10-year report. At a median follow-up of 15 years, 0.69% (95% CI, 0.65%–0.73%) of men in the intervention group and 0.78% (95% CI, 0.73%–0.82%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .03) of men in the control group died of prostate cancer. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between the intervention group (76.8%; 95% CI, 76.6%–77%) and the control group (76.7%; 95% CI, 76.5%–76.9%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .11). The single PSA screening intervention increased detection of low-grade disease (Gleason score ≤6: 2.2% vs. 1.6%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001) but not intermediate- or high-grade disease. Furthermore, PSA screening increased detection of localized disease (T1/T2: 3.6% vs. 3.1%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001) but not locally advanced (T3) or distally advanced (T4, N1, M1) disease. While a relative difference in prostate cancer mortality favoring a single PSA screening test was observed, the absolute magnitude of this difference was small (0.09%). This finding did not translate into a difference in all-cause mortality. Furthermore, achieving this small difference in prostate cancer mortality came at the cost of overdiagnosis of low-grade localized disease, leading to additional medical interventions that did not impact all-cause mortality at a population level.</Para><Para id="_536">Limitations of the CAP trial include the following:<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><OrderedList id="_538" Style="Arabic">

For example, analyzing randomized trial results in various ways is subject to the problem association caused by multiplicities. Statistical conclusions maintain their standard interpretations only when analyzing the trial’s primary end point according to the trial’s protocol or statistical analysis plan. In some settings, statistical adjustments are possible to account for multiplicities. But quite beyond problems of multiplicities, some analyses are so prone to bias that they are of limited value.</Para><Para id="_516">Randomization eliminates or at least minimizes many systematic biases.

An alternative that is sometimes used is an <Strong>as-treated</Strong> or <Strong>as-screened</Strong> analysis, which is prone to important biases. In such analyses, participants who are screened are compared with those who were not screened, regardless of their assigned group.

A participant who chooses to be screened despite randomization to the control group differs from one who accepts an assignment to be screened.

There are similar differences for participants who eschew invitations to be screened versus those who accept assignment to the control group.</Para><Para id="_519">In addition to preserving randomization, an intention-to-screen analysis is most relevant for informing a decision about instituting a screening program or recommendation in some populations.

Most urologists perform a transrectal biopsy using a bioptic gun with ultrasound guidance. Less frequently, a transperineal ultrasound-guided approach can be used for patients who may be at increased risk of complications from a transrectal approach.<Reference refidx="1"/> Over the years, there has been a trend toward taking eight to ten or more biopsy samples from several areas of the prostate with a consequent increased yield of cancer detection after an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test, with a 12-core biopsy now standard practice.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_584">Whether and how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)−directed biopsy should be incorporated into the diagnostic evaluation of prostate cancer is also under evaluation, either as a replacement of, or in addition to, standard systematic prostate needle biopsies. A  multiparametric MRI is performed initially to identify and localize abnormalities that are likely to represent clinically significant prostate cancer. The MRI results are summarized using the 5-point Prostate Imaging–Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) classification scheme, with 1 being very low likelihood and 5 being very high likelihood of clinically significant prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="3"/> Generally, men with a PI-RADS score of 3 or higher for any area of the prostate gland are recommended for MRI-guided biopsy, with the biopsy targeting those areas, and typically, systematic biopsy. Men without any area with a PI-RADS score of 3 or higher may undergo systematic biopsy alone or be followed up without immediate biopsy. </Para><Para id="_585">The data on MRI-guided biopsy have been reported primarily by experienced MRI radiologists and urologists in referral centers, and generalizability of results is uncertain. A multicenter trial randomly assigned 500 men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer to either a systematic biopsy or MRI-guided biopsy. For the latter, men received MRI and then subsequent  MRI-guided biopsy if the MRI was suggestive of prostate cancer.    There were more men with a Gleason score of 7 or less (95 vs. 64) and fewer men with a Gleason score of less than 7 (23 vs. 55) in the MRI group compared with the systematic biopsy group, with fewer biopsies overall in the MRI group.<Reference refidx="4"/> In this study, most of the participating investigators had modest experience with MRI-targeted biopsy. Since men received only systematic or MRI-guided biopsy (and not both), it is unknown how many of the men with Gleason scores less than 7 in the systematic biopsy group would have been upgraded to a Gleason score of 7+ if they had undergone an MRI-guided biopsy.</Para><Para id="_586">A large, single-arm, single-center study of 2,103 men with MRI-visible lesions who underwent both MRI-directed biopsies and standard systematic prostate needle biopsies under ultrasound visualization showed that MRI-directed biopsy alone detected more clinically significant (Gleason score of 4+3 or higher) disease than did systematic biopsy alone.<Reference refidx="5"/> Of 466 men with clinically significant disease that was detected on either type of biopsy modality, MRI-guided biopsy correctly classified 91% of them as clinically significant, while systematic biopsy correctly classified 62% of them as clinically significant. Of all the men studied, 1.9% of men would have had clinically significant disease missed (or misclassified as clinically insignificant disease) if they underwent MRI-guided biopsy alone, compared with 8.3% of men if they underwent systematic biopsy alone. Both studies reported only on histology end points at the time of diagnosis, rather than health outcomes on follow-up.</Para><Para id="_587">A Swedish noninferiority trial randomly assigned 1,532 men with PSA levels more than 3 ng/mL to a standard-biopsy group (n = 603) versus experimental-biopsy group (n = 929).<Reference refidx="6"/> In the experimental group, men received MRI and then standard biopsy plus targeted biopsy, if the MRI findings were suggestive of prostate cancer. The primary outcome was detection of clinically significant cancer (Gleason score ≥7). Detection rates of clinically significant cancer were 18% in the standard group versus 21% in the experimental group, with the experimental group meeting the noninferiority criterion. Biopsy rates were 73% in the standard-treatment group versus 36% in the experimental group.</Para><Para id="_603">A meta-analysis examined the efficacy of integrating MRI into the diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer screening when compared with standard PSA-based screening only.<Reference refidx="7"/> The study analyzed data from 12 randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies involving 80,114 men and found that MRI-based screening reduced unnecessary biopsies and decreased the detection of clinically insignificant prostate cancer, while maintaining the detection of clinically significant cases. Compared with standard
PSA-based screening, the MRI pathway (sequential screening, PI-RADS score ≥3 cutoff for
biopsy) was associated with a greater likelihood of confirming clinically significant prostate cancer when tests results were positive (odds ratio [OR], 4.15;
95% confidence interval [CI], 2.93–5.88; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> ≤ .001). The MRI pathway also decreased the chance of biopsies (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.22–0.36;
<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> ≤ .001) and the detection of clinically insignificant prostate cancers (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23–0.49; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .002),
without significant differences in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.75–1.37;  <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .86). Elevating the PI-RADS cutoff to a score of 4 or higher further reduced biopsy rates and the detection of clinically insignificant prostate cancers compared with PSA-based screening, with no significant difference in clinically significant prostate cancer detection. The study concluded that prostate MRI with targeted biopsies may enhance the accuracy of prostate cancer detection and reduce the risk of overdiagnosis, but further assessment of the type and timing of MRI and biopsy is needed.</Para><Para id="_588">    Several blood- or urine-based markers have been developed to triage men with elevated PSA, especially those with PSA levels ranging from 4 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL. These men should receive biopsy or MRI. Some of these markers have been combined into predictive scores, including the 4K Score, the Prostate Health Index Score, and the Mi Prostate Score.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_589">Prophylactic antibiotics, especially fluoroquinolones, are often used before transrectal needle biopsies.

Treatment options for early-stage disease include radical prostatectomy, definitive radiation therapy, and active surveillance (no immediate treatment until indications of progression are present, but treatment is not designed with curative intent). Multiple series from various years and institutions have reported the outcomes of patients with localized prostate cancer who received no treatment but were followed with surveillance alone. Outcomes have also been reported for active treatments, but valid comparisons of efficacy between surgery, radiation therapy, and watchful waiting are seldom possible because of differences in reporting and selection factors in the various reported series. </Para><Para id="_438">A randomized trial in Scandinavian men published in 2002 explored the benefit of radical prostatectomy over watchful waiting in men with newly diagnosed, well-differentiated, or moderately well-differentiated prostate cancers of clinical stages T1b, T1c, or T2.<Reference refidx="1"/> In this trial, 698 men younger than 75 years, most with clinically detected rather than screen-detected cancers (unlike most newly diagnosed patients in North America) were randomly assigned to the two-arm trial. After 5 years of follow-up, the difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality between radical prostatectomy and watchful waiting groups was 2%; after 10 years of follow-up, the difference was 5.3% (relative risk [RR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36–0.88). There was also a difference of about 5% in all-cause mortality that was apparent only after 10 years of follow-up (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.99). Thus, to extend one life, 20 men with palpable, clinically localized prostate cancer would need to undergo radical prostatectomy rather than watchful waiting. Because most prostate cancers that are detected today with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening are not palpable, this study may not be directly generalizable to the average newly diagnosed patient in the United States.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_353">A Swedish retrospective study of a nationwide cohort of patients with localized prostate cancer aged 70 years or younger reported that 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality was 2.4% among men diagnosed with clinically local stage T1a, T1b, or T1c, with a serum PSA of less than 10 ng/mL, and with a Gleason score of 2 to 6, referred to as low-risk cases, of which there were 2,686.<Reference refidx="3"/> This subgroup analysis was derived from a cohort study of 6,849 men diagnosed between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2002, aged 70 years or younger, who had local stage T1 to T2 with no signs of lymph node metastases or bone metastases, and a PSA serum level of less than 20 ng/mL, as was abstracted from the Swedish Cancer Registry, which captured 98% of solid tumors among men aged 75 years or younger. Cohort treatment options were surveillance (n = 2,021) or curative intent by radical prostatectomy (n = 3,399) or radiation therapy (n = 1,429), which were to be determined at the discretion of treating physicians. Surveillance or expectancy treatment was either active surveillance with curative treatment if progression occurred or watchful waiting—a strategy for administering hormonal treatment upon symptomatic progression.</Para><Para id="_615">Using all-cause mortality as the benchmark, the study calculated cumulative incidence mortality for the three treatment groups of the entire cohort and the low-risk subgroup. Surveillance was more common among men with high comorbidity and among men with low-risk tumors. The 10-year cumulative risk of death from prostate cancer for the entire 6,849-person cohort was 3.6% in the surveillance group and 2.7% in the curative-intent group, compared with the low-risk surveillance group (2.4%) and the low-risk curative-intent group (0.7%). Biases inherent in treatment assignment could not be accounted for adequately in the analysis, which prevented conclusions about the relative effectiveness of alternative treatments. However, a 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality of 2.4% among patients with low-risk prostate cancer in the surveillance group suggested that surveillance may be a suitable treatment for many patients with low-risk disease compared, with the 19.2% 10-year risk of death from competing causes observed in the surveillance group and 10.2% in the curative-intent group of the total 6,849 person cohort.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_354">The Prostate Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) was the first trial conducted in the PSA screening era that directly compared radical prostatectomy with watchful waiting.<Reference refidx="5"/> From November 1994 through January 2002, 731 men aged 75 years or younger with localized prostate cancer were randomly assigned to one of the two management strategies. About 50% of the men had nonpalpable, screen-detected disease. After a median follow-up of 10 years (maximum up to about 15 years), there was no statistically significant difference in overall or prostate-specific mortality.

The primary end point was death from prostate cancer, and secondary outcomes were clinical (local) progression, metastases, and death from all causes. Active monitoring in this study, unlike the PIVOT and Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Trial 4 (SPCG-4) trials, used PSA levels to determine when more aggressive treatment would be administered. Within 9 months of randomization, compliance rates for the three groups were 88% for the monitoring group, 71% for the surgery group, and 74% for the radiation therapy group. By 10 years, 55% of men in the active monitoring group had undergone radical prostatectomy. Seventeen deaths occurred during the median 10 years of follow-up, and no significant differences were seen between the groups in prostate cancer-specific or all-cause mortality. More metastases (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .004) and more disease progression (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001) were seen in the monitoring group. There were 62 cases of metastases and 204 cases of disease progression.</Para><Para id="_468">The results suggest that radical treatment has no effect on mortality, although the power to see cause-specific mortality effects was low. Avoidance of metastases or progression could be a rationale for more aggressive treatment, although another study <Reference refidx="7"/> showed that active monitoring eliminated much of the pain and suffering caused by aggressive treatments.</Para><Para id="_469">In a substudy of ProtecT that examined patient-reported outcomes, the response rate was over 85% for most of the questionnaires used to examine quality of life. The study addressed urinary, bowel, and sexual function, and specific effects of treatment on quality of life, anxiety and depression, and general health. No methods were employed to deal with nonresponse or missing responses. In a quality-of-life study, nonresponse tends to be informative, so this is unusual.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_470">Results showed that men who had undergone prostatectomy reported more impotence and incontinence; men who received radiation therapy reported more bowel dysfunction; and men who received active monitoring reported the lowest levels of these adverse effects.

Several studies have addressed whether complexed PSA or percent-free PSA (ratio of free to total) are more sensitive and specific than total PSA. One retrospective study evaluated total PSA, free/total, and complexed PSA in a group of 300 men, 75 of whom had prostate cancer. Large values of total, small values of free/total, and large values of complexed PSA were associated with the presence of cancer; the authors chose the cutoff of each measure to yield 95% sensitivity and found estimated specificities of 21.8% in total PSA, 15.6% in free/total PSA, and 26.7% in complexed PSA.<Reference refidx="6"/> The preponderance of evidence concerning the utility of complexed and percent-free PSA is not clear; however, total PSA remains the standard.</Para><Para id="_359">Several authors have considered whether complexed PSA or percent-free PSA in conjunction with total PSA can improve total PSA sensitivity.

come into common use until  the late 1980s for the early diagnosis of prostate
cancer.  Following widespread dissemination of PSA testing, incidence rates rose abruptly.  In a study of Medicare
beneficiaries, a first-time PSA test was associated with a 4.7% likelihood of a
prostate cancer diagnosis within 3 months.  Subsequent tests were associated
with statistically significant lower rates of prostate cancer diagnosis.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_379">A study  examined trends in prostate cancer detection and diagnosis among
140,936 White men and 15,662 African American men diagnosed with prostate cancer
between 1973 and 1994 by analyzing data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.<Reference refidx="2"/> Substantial changes were found
beginning in the late 1980s as use of PSA spread throughout the United States. Age at diagnosis fell, stage of disease at diagnosis
decreased, and most tumors were noted to be moderately differentiated.  For
African American men, however, a larger proportion of tumors were poorly
differentiated.</Para><Para id="_380">Because the outset of PSA screening beginning around 1988, incidence rates
initially rose dramatically and fell, presumably as the fraction of the
population undergoing their first PSA screening initially rose and subsequently
fell.  There has also been an observed decrease in mortality rates.  In Olmsted
County, Minnesota, age-adjusted prostate cancer mortality rates 
increased from 25.8 per 100,000 men from 1980 to
1984 to a peak of 34 per 100,000 from 1989 to 1992; rates subsequently
decreased to 19.4 per 100,000 from 1993 to 1997.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Similar observations
have been made elsewhere in the world,<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> leading some to hypothesize that
the mortality decline is related to PSA testing.  In Quebec, Canada,
however, examinations of the association between the size of the increase in
incidence rates (1989–1993) and the size of the decrease in mortality
rates (1995–1999), by birth cohort and residential grouping, showed no
correlation between these two variables.<Reference refidx="5"/>  This study suggests that, at least
during this time frame, the decline in mortality was not related to widespread PSA
testing.  </Para><Para id="_381">Cause-of-death misclassification has also been studied as a possible explanation for changes in prostate cancer mortality. A relatively fixed rate was found at which individuals who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer were mislabeled as having died from prostate cancer. As such, the substantial increase in prostate cancer diagnoses in the late 1980s and early 1990s would then explain the increased rate of prostate cancer death during those years. As the rate of prostate cancer diagnosis fell in the early 1990s, this reduced rate of mislabeling death due to prostate cancer would fall, as would the overall rate of prostate cancer death.<Reference refidx="6"/> Because the evidence in this respect is inconsistent, it remains
unclear whether the causes of these mortality trends are chance, misclassification, early detection,
improved treatments, or a combination of effects.</Para><Para id="_382">The incidence of distant-stage prostate carcinoma was relatively flat until 1991 and then started declining rapidly. This decline probably was caused by the shift to  earlier stage disease associated with the rapid dissemination of  PSA screening. This stage shift can have a fairly sizable and rapid impact on population mortality, but it is   possible  that other factors such as hormonal therapy are   responsible for much of the decline in mortality. Ongoing randomized clinical trials in the United States and Europe are designed to determine whether a mortality benefit is associated with PSA screening.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_383">The Gleason score is an important prognostic measure relying on the pathological assessment of the architectural growth patterns of prostate biopsy.  The Gleason grading system assigns a grade to each of the two largest areas of prostate cancer in the tissue samples.   A sampling of eight or more biopsy cores improves the pathological grading accuracy.<Reference refidx="8"/> Grades range from 1 to 5, with 1 being the most differentiated and 5 the least differentiated.  Grade 3 tumors seldom have associated metastases, but metastases are common with grade 4 or grade 5 tumors.  The two grades are added together to produce a Gleason score.  A score of 2 to 4 is rarely given, 5 to 6 is low grade, 7 is intermediate grade,  and 8 to 10 is high grade.    The overall rate of concordance between original interpretations and review of the needle biopsy specimens has been reported to be 60%, with accuracy improving with increased tumor grade and percentage of tumor involvement in the biopsy specimen.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_384">As of 2005, approximately 90% of prostate cancers detected were clinically localized and had more favorable  tumor characteristics or grades than in the pre-PSA screening era.<Reference refidx="10"/>     A retrospective population-cohort study using the Connecticut Tumor registry reviewed the mortality probability from prostate cancer given the patient’s age    at diagnosis and tumor grade.<Reference refidx="11"/> Patients were treated with either observation or immediate or delayed androgen withdrawal therapy, with a median observation of 24 years.    This study was initiated before the PSA screening era.  Transurethral resection or open surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia  identified 71% of the tumors incidentally.
The prostate cancer mortality rate was 33 per 1,000 person-years during the first 15 years of follow-up (95% confidence interval [CI], 28–38) and 18 per 1,000 person-years after 15 years of follow-up (95% CI, 10–29). Men with low-grade prostate cancers had a minimal risk of dying from prostate cancer during 20 years of follow-up (Gleason score of 2 to 4; six deaths per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI, 2–11). Men with high-grade prostate cancers had an increased probability of dying from prostate cancer within 10 years of diagnosis (Gleason score of 8 to 10, 121 deaths per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI, 90–156). Men with tumors that had a Gleason score of 5 or 6 had an intermediate risk of prostate cancer death. The annual mortality rate from prostate cancer appears to remain stable after 15 years from diagnosis.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="9934717" MedlineID="99131416">Legler JM, Feuer EJ, Potosky AL, et al.: The role of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing patterns in the recent prostate cancer incidence decline in the United States.

has yet to take place.  The examination is inexpensive, relatively noninvasive, and nonmorbid and can be taught to nonprofessional health workers; however, its effectiveness depends on the skill and experience of the examiner. The possible contribution of routine annual screening by rectal examination in reducing prostate cancer mortality remains to be determined. </Para><Para id="_442">Several observational studies have examined process measures such as sensitivity and case-survival data,
but without appropriate controls and with no adjustment for lead-time and
length biases.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_387">In 1984,  one study reported on 811 unselected patients aged 50 to 80 years  who underwent rectal examination and follow-up.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Of 43
patients with a palpable abnormality in the prostate, 38 agreed to undergo biopsy. 
The positive predictive value (PPV) of a palpable nodule, i.e., prostate cancer on
biopsy, was 29% (11 of 38).  Further evaluation revealed that 45% of the cases
were stage B, 36% were stage C, and 18% were stage D.  More results from the
same investigators revealed a 25% PPV, with 68% of the
detected tumors clinically localized but only approximately 30% pathologically
localized after radical prostatectomy.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Some investigators reported a high proportion of clinically localized disease when prostate cancer
is detected by routine rectal examination,<Reference refidx="5"/> while others reported that even
with annual rectal examination, only 20% of cases are localized at
diagnosis.<Reference refidx="6"/>  It has been reported that 25% of men
presenting with metastatic disease had a normal prostate examination.<Reference refidx="7"/>
Another case-control study examining screening with both DRE and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) found a reduction in prostate cancer mortality that was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR], 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46–1.1). Most men in this study were screened with DRE rather than PSA.<Reference refidx="8"/> All four of these case-control studies are consistent with a reduction of 20% to 30% in prostate cancer mortality. Potential biases inherent in this study design, however, limit the ability to draw conclusions on the basis of this evidence alone.</Para><Para id="_388">Since PSA assays became widely available in the late 1980s, DRE alone is rarely discussed as a screening modality.  Several studies have found that DRE has a poor predictive value for
prostate cancer if PSA is at very low levels.  In the European Study on
Screening for Prostate Cancer,  it was found that if DRE is used only for a
PSA higher than 1.5 ng/mL (thus, no DRE is performed with PSA &lt;1.5 ng/mL), 29% of all
biopsies would be eliminated while maintaining a 95% prostate cancer detection
sensitivity.  By applying DRE only for patients with a PSA higher than 2.0 ng/mL, the
biopsy rate would decrease by 36%, while sensitivity would drop to only 92%.<Reference refidx="9"/> 
A previous report from this same institution found DRE to have poor performance
characteristics.  Among 10,523 men randomly assigned to screening, it was
reported that the overall prostate cancer detection rate using PSA, DRE, and
transrectal ultrasound was 4.5%, compared with only 2.5% if DRE alone was used.  Among men
with a PSA lower than 3.0 ng/mL, the PPV of DRE was only
4% to 11%.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Despite the poor performance of DRE, a retrospective
case-control study of men in Olmsted County, Minnesota, who died of prostate
cancer found that case patients were less likely to have undergone DRE during
the 10 years before diagnosis of prostate cancer (OR,  0.51; 95%
 CI, 0.31–0.84).  These data suggested that screening DREs
may prevent 50% to 70% of deaths from prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="11"/>  Contrary to
these findings, results from a case-control study of 150 men who ultimately
died of prostate cancer were compared with 299 controls without disease.  In this
different population, a similar number of cases and controls had undergone DRE
during the 10-year interval before prostate cancer diagnosis.<Reference refidx="12"/>  One
case-control study reported no statistically significant association between
routine screening with DRE and occurrence of metastatic
prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="13"/>
The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial requested that all men undergo prostate biopsy at study end to address ascertainment bias; the sensitivity of DRE for prostate cancer was 16.7%.  The sensitivity increased to 21.3% in men receiving finasteride.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="5107353" MedlineID="71055958">Gilbertsen VA: Cancer of the prostate gland.

prevalence of histologically defined cancer.  It has been demonstrated that
a considerable fraction (approximately one-third) of men in their fourth and
fifth decades have histologically evident prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Most of these
tumors are well-differentiated and microscopic in size.  Conversely, evidence
suggests that tumors of potential clinical  importance are larger and of higher
grade.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Since the inception of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, the following events have occurred:
(1) a contemporaneous but unrelated decrease in detection of transition-zone
tumors, caused by a fall in the number of transurethral resections of the
prostate due to the advent of effective treatment for benign prostatic
hyperplasia (including  alpha blockers and finasteride); and (2) an increase in
detection of peripheral-zone tumors due to the incorporation of transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies.  Because transition-zone tumors are
predominantly low volume and low grade and because peripheral-zone tumors have a
preponderance of moderate-grade and high-grade disease, the proportion of higher-grade tumors detected by current screening practices has increased
substantially.  A Detroit study found that between 1989 and 1996, 
poorly differentiated tumors remained stable and well-differentiated tumors
fell in frequency while moderately differentiated disease increased in
frequency.  The largest rise in incidence was in clinically localized
disease.<Reference refidx="3"/> It is now known that systematic changes to the histological interpretation of biopsy specimens by anatomical pathologists has occurred during the PSA screening era (i.e.,   since about 1985) in the United States.<Reference refidx="4"/> This phenomenon, sometimes called grade inflation, is the apparent increase in the distribution of high-grade tumors in the population over time        but in the absence of a true biological or clinical change.

The models were also developed to compare these trends with the reported decrease in prostate cancer deaths observed in the United States since the early 1990s, to investigate the cost-effectiveness of various screening strategies, and to attempt to estimate overdiagnosis resulting from screening.</Para><Para id="_439"> 

One of the first models looked at trends in prostate cancer detection compared with prostate cancer deaths between 1992 and 1994. Changes in prostate cancer mortality could not be explained entirely by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening alone.<Reference refidx="1"/> Simulation modeling from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) program suggested that the combination of changes in prostate cancer treatment, improvements in disease management after primary therapy, and screening contributed to the drop in prostate cancer mortality.<Reference refidx="2"/>  CISNET models calibrated to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program incidence data were also used to estimate overdiagnosis caused by PSA screening in the United States, suggesting 23% to 42% of all screen-detected prostate cancers were overdiagnosed.<Reference refidx="3"/>  An analysis using the Microsimulation Screening Analysis (MISCAN) model and data from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer trial predicted the numbers of prostate cancers diagnosed, the prostate cancer deaths averted, the quality-adjusted life years gained, and the cost-effectiveness of 68 screening strategies.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_440">An example of the underlying assumptions and concerns about models is provided by a microsimulation modeling effort that examined the comparative effectiveness of 35 screening strategies, which varied by start and stop ages, screening intervals, and thresholds for biopsy referral.<Reference refidx="5"/> The CISNET model assumes prostate cancer progression from onset to metastasis to clinical diagnosis in the absence of screening, with risks of events indicated by PSA levels. Event rates through the progression states are identified by matching model incidence to observed incidence, although it is not clear that the rates so identified are unique. Survival depends on stage at diagnosis, and screening is assumed to identify some cancers at an earlier stage than without screening, leading to a reduction in mortality.  This <Strong>stage-shift</Strong> model is virtually guaranteed to produce a benefit of screening.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="10379966" MedlineID="99306634">Etzioni R, Legler JM, Feuer EJ, et al.: Cancer surveillance series: interpreting trends in prostate cancer--part III: Quantifying the link between population prostate-specific antigen testing and recent declines in prostate cancer mortality.

Any potential benefits derived from screening asymptomatic men  need to be weighed against the harms of screening and diagnostic procedures and treatments for prostate cancer. These harms are particularly burdensome to men with false-positive screening results and men who are unnecessarily treated because of overdiagnosis.</Para><Para id="_484"> An unintended consequence of screening and biopsy is the erroneous assumption that a screened population is at increased risk of developing significant disease. In a study that examined the magnitude of prostate cancer risk associated with specific factors across the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) and Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial cohorts, the authors demonstrated that the likelihood of undergoing screening and biopsy depends on certain known or suspected risk factors.  In turn, differential screening and biopsy can result in spurious conclusions regarding risk factors for prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/> For example, the authors explained that the labeling of a random characteristic such as blue eyes as a risk factor may increase biopsy rates among men with blue eyes, resulting in detection of  indolent prostate cancer and leading to the inaccurate conclusion that blue eyes are a risk factor for prostate cancer.</Para><Para id="_486">Negative impacts of screen detection on measures of risk may include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_487" Style="bullet">

Past and current screening and biopsy practices may misrepresent prostate cancer risk factors.  Better methods for identifying consequential prostate cancer are needed to avoid unnecessary biopsies.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_445">Three cohort studies in Sweden and the United States linked databases to examine the association between a new diagnosis of prostate cancer and cardiovascular events/death or suicide.  One Swedish study found that in the first year after a diagnosis of prostate cancer, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) was increased in men diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with men who were not diagnosed with prostate cancer (relative risk [RR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9–2.0; adjusted for age, calendar period, and time since diagnosis).  The risk of death from CVD was highest in the first week after diagnosis (RR, 11.2; 95% CI, 10.4–12.1) and was also higher in younger men (age &lt;54 years).  These risks were lower in men diagnosed in the most recent time periods.  Also, in the first year after diagnosis, the risk of committing suicide was higher for men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer (RR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.1–3.0; adjusted for age, calendar period, marital status, educational level, and history of psychiatric hospitalization).  Again, this was highest in the first week after diagnosis (RR, 8.4; 95% CI, 1.9–22.7).<Reference refidx="2"/> A second Swedish study largely confirmed these findings.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_446">A U.S. cohort study explored the association between prostate cancer diagnosis and CVD mortality or suicide in men diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with population-level expected rates during three different time periods (preprostate-specific antigen [pre-PSA], peri-PSA, and post-PSA).  For CVD mortality, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was elevated for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the first month after diagnosis in all time periods (overall SMR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.89–2.22), but the SMR decreased in later months during the first year (decreasing to &lt;1.0 in the PSA time period).  This association was not changed significantly by age, race, or tumor grade. SMRs were higher for nonmarried men, for men who lived in lower educational status or higher poverty counties, and for men with metastatic disease at diagnosis.  Also, in the first 3 months after diagnosis, the SMR for suicide was higher in men with prostate cancer (SMR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6).  In months 4 to 12, the SMR was lower but still greater than 1.0.  The SMR for suicide, however, was greater than 1.0 only in the pre-PSA and peri-PSA time periods, but not in the post-PSA time period.  SMR was higher for nonmarried men but did not vary by education or poverty.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_447">These data lend credence to the concern that  overdiagnosis of  prostate cancer due to screening could lead to an increased risk of CVD mortality or suicide.</Para><Para id="_448">Although there is no literature suggesting serious complications of digital rectal examination (DRE) or transrectal sonography, and the harms associated with venipuncture for PSA testing can be regarded as trivial, prostatic biopsies are associated with important complications. Transient fever, pain, hematospermia, and hematuria are all common, as are positive urine cultures.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>    Sepsis occurs in approximately 0.4% of men.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_449">Long-term complications of radical prostatectomy include urinary incontinence, urethral stricture, erectile dysfunction, and the morbidity associated with general anesthesia and a major surgical procedure. Fecal incontinence can also occur. The associated mortality rate is reported to be 0.1% to   1%, depending on age. In the population-based Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study,  8.4% of 1,291 men were incontinent and 59.9% were impotent at 18 or 24 months following radical prostatectomy. More than 40% of men reported that their sexual performance was a moderate-to-large problem. Both sexual and urinary function varied by age, with younger men relatively less affected.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_450">Definitive external-beam radiation therapy can result in acute cystitis, proctitis, and sometimes enteritis. These conditions are generally reversible but may be chronic. In the short-term, potency is preserved with irradiation in most cases but may diminish over time. A systematic review of evidence radiation therapy complications shows that 20% to 40% of men who had no erectile dysfunction before treatment developed dysfunction 12 to 24 months afterward. Furthermore,     2% to 16% of men who had no urinary incontinence before treatment developed dysfunction 12 to 24 months afterward, and about 18% of men had some bowel dysfunction 1 year after treatment. The magnitude of effects of brachytherapy has not been determined, but the spectrum of complications are similar.<Reference refidx="10"/> Radiation to the prostate has been reported to  increase the risk of secondary malignancies, most notably of the rectum and bladder.  While the relative risk in a large Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-based study was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.21–1.30), the absolute increase in risk is low. The same review of evidence found hormone therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists reduces sexual function by 40% to 70%, and hormone therapy is associated with breast swelling in 5% to 25% of men. Hot flashes occur in 50% to 60% of men taking LHRH agonists.<Reference refidx="8"/> For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Prostate Cancer Treatment</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_451">The question of whether prostate cancer treatment contributes to symptoms among screened prostate cancer survivors was addressed in an analysis from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. The 
randomized controlled PLCO analysis compared 529 prostate cancer survivors, 5 to 10 years postdiagnosis, with 514 noncancer controls, regarding prostate cancer-specific symptomatology. There was poorer sexual and urinary function among prostate cancer survivors compared with noncancer controls, suggesting that these symptoms are related to prostate cancer treatment, not aging or comorbidities.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_452">Screening has increased the incidence of prostate cancer.  In the current medical climate, most early-stage prostate cancers are treated by radical surgery or irradiation with intent to eradicate the pathology.  There is evidence that not all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer because of screening are in immediate need of curative treatment.  Death from other causes often occurs before screen detected, localized, and well-differentiated malignancies affect the survival of these patients.  To avoid overtreatment and consequent morbid events, active surveillance (AS) is an emerging strategy applicable in these kinds of cases wherein curative treatment is delayed pending objective medical evidence of disease progression.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_453">The effectiveness of AS was investigated retrospectively in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) trial.  Data from 577 men diagnosed with prostate cancer because of periodic screening between 1994 and 2007 at a mean age of 66.3 years in four participating clinical centers in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Finland were evaluated. Selection criteria for inclusion in the analysis were:</Para><ItemizedList id="_454" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>PSA less than or equal to 10 ng/mL.</ListItem><ListItem>PSA density less than 0.2 ng/mL.</ListItem><ListItem>Stage T1C/T2.</ListItem><ListItem>Gleason score less than or equal to 3 + 3 = 6.</ListItem><ListItem>No more than two positive biopsy cores.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_455">Men with positive lymph nodes or distant metastases at the time of diagnosis were excluded from the analysis.  These are the same thresholds being applied in the (yet unreported) prospective Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance   study on AS originating from ERSPC and in the (also unreported) protocol-based prospective study of AS in Canada.</Para><Para id="_456">The mean follow-up time for the 577 men in the retrospective assessment was 4.35 years (0–11.63 years).  The calculated 10-year prostate cancer-specific survival rate was 100%.  The overall 10-year survival rate was 77%.  The calculated 10-year deferred treatment-free survival rate was 43%.</Para><Para id="_457">After 7.75 years,   50% of men had received treatment.  The median treatment-free survival was 2.5 years.     Men treated during follow-up were slightly younger at diagnosis than men remaining untreated (64.7 years vs. 67.0 years; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt;           .001).  Of the 110 men shifting to active treatment despite favorable PSA levels and PSA doubling times,  DRE was known in 53 of the men and played a role in nine of them, whereas rebiopsies were known in 27 of the men and played a role in none of them.  On the basis of PSA characteristics, 1.9% of patients who remained untreated may have been better candidates for active treatment, while 55.8% of men who received active treatment were not obvious candidates for radical treatment, and neither DRE nor rebiopsy explained the discrepancy.  Factors like anxiety and urologic complaints may have been more explanatory, but the data were not available.</Para><Para id="_458">The authors concluded that their data confirmed previous studies'                          findings, that  many screen-detected prostate cancers may be actively followed (e.g., AS), and curative treatment delayed, thereby delaying or avoiding the morbid consequences of radical therapy without diminishing survival.  The authors also noted that a considerable fraction of men do not comply with the AS regimen, apparently for psychological reasons, and  AS often resulted in delay, not avoidance, of radical therapy.</Para><Para id="_463">In the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study, 1,643 men with localized prostate cancer were randomly assigned equally to active monitoring, surgery, or radiation therapy. The primary end point was death from prostate cancer, and secondary outcomes were clinical (local) progression, metastases, and death from all causes.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_465">In a substudy of ProtecT that examined patient-reported outcomes, the response rate was over 85% for most of the questionnaires used to examine quality of life. The study addressed urinary, bowel, and sexual function and specific effects on quality of life, anxiety and depression, and general health. No methods were employed to deal with nonresponse or missing responses. In a quality-of-life study, nonresponse tends to be informative, so this lapse is unusual.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_466">Results showed that men who had undergone prostatectomy reported more impotence and incontinence; men who received radiation reported more bowel dysfunction; and men who received active monitoring reported the lowest levels of these adverse effects. In general, differences decreased over the 6 years that data were collected. Overall, mental and physical health did not differ by treatment.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_459">Whatever the screening modality, the screening process itself can lead to psychological effects in men who have a prostate biopsy but do not have prostate cancer. One study of these men at 12 months after their negative biopsy who reported worrying that they may develop cancer (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001), showed large increases in prostate-cancer worry compared with men with a normal PSA (26% vs. 6%).<Reference refidx="15"/> In the same study, biopsied men were more likely than those in the normal PSA group to have had at least one follow-up PSA test in the first year (73% vs. 42%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001), more likely to have had another biopsy (15% vs. 1%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt;  .001), and more likely to have visited a urologist (71% vs. 13%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001).</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="27998216">Tangen CM, Goodman PJ, Till C, et al.: Biases in Recommendations for and Acceptance of Prostate Biopsy Significantly Affect Assessment of Prostate Cancer Risk Factors: Results From Two Large Randomized Clinical Trials.
