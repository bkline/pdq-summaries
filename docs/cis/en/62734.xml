Few studies of people undergoing cancer treatment have addressed the issue of fatigue as a result of the emotional distress associated with undergoing a diagnostic evaluation for cancer and the effects of medical and surgical procedures used for evaluation and for initial treatment.

Understanding the causes of fatigue in people with cancer is especially challenging because each individual may experience multiple possible causes of fatigue simultaneously.  Multiple underlying etiological factors beyond the type and treatment of cancer have been proposed, including psychological distress, life demands, sleep disturbance, neurophysiological changes, disruption of circadian rhythms, cardiac issues, neuroimmunological changes, and genetic variations.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_254">Growing evidence, particularly for women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer, suggests that fatigue is associated with markers of increased immune inflammatory activity.  When fatigued individuals with a history of breast cancer are compared with breast cancer survivors without fatigue, different patterns emerge with respect to interleukin-6, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, C-reactive protein, neopterin, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-II.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  Although the precise relationships—and the clinical meaning of those relationships—are not yet known, increased cytokines likely contribute to the symptoms of asthenia, fatigue, and lethargy. However, so far no large, well-controlled studies have evaluated the effects of general anti-inflammatory agents on fatigue or cytokine biomarkers.</Para><Para id="_255">     Other studies demonstrate a change in the regulation of cortisol by the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.  One key study put fatigued and nonfatigued breast cancer survivors through a stress battery in a laboratory setting.   Nonfatigued survivors mounted a significant cortisol increase in response to acute stress, while fatigued survivors had a very blunted response.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Another study has shown that fatigued breast cancer survivors have flattened cortisol slopes, having higher levels of cortisol at the end of the day than do  nonfatigued survivors.<Reference refidx="7"/>  It is the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that may account for the prolonged inflammatory cytokine milieu. Understanding the body’s response to numerous chronic stressors in cancer may help in managing fatigue.</Para><Para id="_257">Finally, another theory is that chronic exposure to proinflammatory cytokines negatively impacts serotonin levels.  One hypothesis is that the relationship between central nervous system concentrations of serotonin and fatigue have a U-shaped relationship, suggesting that very high and very low levels of serotonin may be associated with cancer-related fatigue.<Reference refidx="8"/> However, studies that have evaluated serotonergic agents have not demonstrated a benefit for fatigue.<Reference refidx="9"/> The role and relationship of many important neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin with HPA axis functioning and cytokine expression have yet to be fully understood.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="25113839">Bower JE: Cancer-related fatigue--mechanisms, risk factors, and treatments.

and fear associated with a cancer diagnosis—and the impact of that diagnosis on a
person’s physical, psychosocial, and financial well-being—are sources of
emotional stress.  Distress associated with the cancer diagnosis alone may
trigger fatigue.  A study of 74 early-stage breast cancer patients with no
history of affective disorder assessed various symptoms of adjustment
approximately 2 weeks after diagnosis. About 45% of participants noted moderate or high levels
of fatigue.  This fatigue may have been secondary to the increased cognitive
strain of dealing with the diagnosis or to insomnia, reported as moderate to severe by about 60% of patients.  Therefore, fatigue may begin before
treatment as a result of worry or other cognitive factors, both primary and secondary
to insomnia.

Attention fatigue may be relieved by activities that promote rest and restore directed attention.<Reference refidx="58"/>  Although sleep is necessary for relieving attention
fatigue and restoring attention, it is insufficient when attention demands are
high.  Research in this area is limited and most commonly conducted in breast cancer patients, potentially limiting its application across diverse populations.

Investigators noted significant improvement in fatigue at 3 months posttreatment, as well as improved vitality immediately posttreatment and at 3 months posttreatment. However, the study failed to find significant differences in fatigue immediately posttreatment.</Para><Para id="_438">In one large, multicenter phase III randomized controlled trial, investigators examined the effect of a standardized 4-week yoga therapy program (Yoga for Cancer Survivors [YOCAS]) on fatigue compared with standard survivorship care in 410 cancer survivors.<Reference refidx="66"/> Compared with participants receiving standard survivorship care, the YOCAS participants demonstrated significantly greater improvements in fatigue (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .01), as well as decreased interference of fatigue in walking, physical activity, and quality of life (all <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .05).

One fairly large study evaluated medical qigong for CRF in a heterogeneous group of 162 patients during or after cancer treatment.<Reference refidx="63"/>  This study reported significant improvements in fatigue and several other aspects of quality of life for the intervention group versus usual care.</Para><Para id="_443">The qigong intervention was delivered in 90-minute group sessions, twice a week for 10 weeks, for 1,800 minutes of treatment.  The usual-care group did not receive any group meetings or additional provider interaction.  It is therefore difficult to say what qigong uniquely provided over and above nonspecific or group-interaction effects.  It is also not known how much survivors would need to continue performing qigong to maintain benefits.  There were no adverse events in this study, so other than time and resource expenditure, it is difficult to pinpoint a downside to encouraging patients to adopt such an activity.  One important strength of the study was the collection of serum to measure markers of inflammation.  At the end of 10 weeks, the C-reactive protein level of patients in the medical qigong group decreased by 3.6 mg/L, while patients in the usual-care group experienced an increase of 19.57 mg/L, a statistically significant difference.<Reference refidx="63"/></Para><Para id="_444">A second smaller study (N = 96) that compared a qigong group to a wait-list control group evaluated fatigue using the BFI as a secondary outcome; it also assessed a biological measure, salivary cortisol.<Reference refidx="64"/>  This study did not find any significant difference in fatigue or cortisol between groups.  The intervention dose in this study, comprising five 40-minute sessions over 6 weeks of radiation therapy in women diagnosed with breast cancer, was much lower than the intervention dose in the larger study described above.</Para><Para id="_445">The major weakness limiting interpretation and integration of both of these studies, despite differing results,  is that there was no attempt to control for attention or any of the social aspects of the intervention.</Para><Para id="_446">In a third small study (N = 76), men with prostate cancer undergoing radiation therapy were randomly assigned to qigong/<SummaryRef href="CDR0000062734#_462" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue/fatigue-hp-pdq">tai chi</SummaryRef>, light exercise, or a waiting list.<Reference refidx="65"/> The qigong/tai chi group reported improvements in sleep duration midway during radiation therapy treatment (6.7 hours vs. 7 hours); however, this effect was not durable. There were no differences between groups in fatigue or sleep outcomes, suggesting that this may not be an effective intervention during radiation therapy for prostate cancer. The symptoms of fatigue and poor sleep were highly correlated with the physical symptom burden of men with prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="65"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_461"><Title>Tai chi</Title><Para id="_462">Tai chi is a Chinese martial arts activity that involves deep breathing, exercise, and slow movement with a meditative aspect, connecting the individual’s physical, mental, and emotional states.

Study assessments were conducted before the first and third courses of chemotherapy and at the end of the fourth course. Fatigue scores increased in all patients. However, in the tai chi group at 6 weeks, general and physical fatigue subscale scores were lower (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .05) and vigor subscale scores were higher, compared with the scores of the exercise group  (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .05).

However, more than half of the cancer survivors (52%) who recovered from severe fatigue at the time of the post-CBT assessment maintained their low fatigue levels at the 10-year follow-up.  While levels of fatigue deteriorated over time, the strong maintenance gains for more than half of the study population suggest that CBT for CRF can help control fatigue over long periods of time.</Para><Para id="_451">While CBT and medication therapy may often work hand in hand, some studies show that CBT alone has a more powerful impact on fatigue than medication alone.
