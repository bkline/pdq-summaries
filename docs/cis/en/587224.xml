The PDQ childhood brain tumor treatment summaries are primarily organized according to the World Health Organization classification of nervous system tumors.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> Brain tumors are classified according to histology, but immunohistochemical analysis, cytogenetic and molecular genetic findings, and measures of mitotic activity are increasingly used in tumor diagnosis and classification. Tumor location, extent of spread, and age at diagnosis are important factors that affect treatment and prognosis.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  For a description of the classification of nervous system tumors and a link to the corresponding treatment summary for each type of brain tumor, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062680" url="/types/brain/hp/child-brain-treatment-pdq">Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Summary Index</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_139">CNS AT/RT  is a rare, clinically aggressive tumor that most often affects children aged 3 years and younger but can occur in older children and adults. Approximately one-half of AT/RTs arise in the posterior fossa.<Reference refidx="6"/> The diagnostic evaluation includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neuraxis and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid examination. AT/RT has been linked to somatic and germline variants of <GeneName>SMARCB1</GeneName> and, less commonly, <GeneName>SMARCA4</GeneName>, both of which act as tumor suppressor genes.<Reference refidx="7"/> There is no evidence-based standard treatment for children with AT/RT.

Histologically, cribriform neuroepithelial tumor is characterized by the presence of cribriform strands and ribbons, but there is an absence of rhabdoid tumor cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Like AT/RT TYR, tyrosinase expression is commonly observed. The outcome of patients with cribriform neuroepithelial tumor is more favorable than the outcome of patients with AT/RT TYR.
