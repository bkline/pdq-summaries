cancer affects women more often than men and usually occurs in
people aged 25 to 65 years.  The incidence of this malignancy has
been increasing over the last decade.  Thyroid cancer commonly presents
as a so-called cold nodule. It is detected as a palpable thyroid gland during a physical examination and evaluated with iodine I 131  scans. Scintigraphy shows that the isotope is not taken up in an area of the gland.  The overall incidence of cancer in a cold nodule is 12% to
15%, but it is higher in people younger than 40 years and in people with calcifications present on preoperative ultrasonography.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_424"><Title>Anatomy</Title><Para id="_747">Thyroid gland tissue envelops the upper trachea just below the thyroid and cricoid cartilages that make up the larynx.

malignancies of the thyroid gland appear as early as 5 years

extracapsular extension or vascular invasion is better for patients younger than 40 years.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_580">Patients considered  at low risk according to age, metastases, extent, and size risk criteria include women younger than 50 years and men younger
than 40 years without evidence of distant metastases.  The low-risk group also includes older patients with primary papillary tumors    smaller than 5
cm without evidence of gross extrathyroidal
invasion, and older patients with follicular cancer without major capsular invasion or blood
vessel invasion.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Using these criteria, a retrospective study of 1,019
patients showed that the 20-year survival rate was 98% for patients with low-risk disease and
50% for patients with high-risk disease.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_536">A
retrospective surgical series of 931 previously untreated patients with
differentiated thyroid cancer found that age older than 45 years, follicular histology, primary tumor   larger than 4
cm (T2–T3), extrathyroidal extension (T4), and distant metastases were adverse prognostic factors.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/> Favorable prognostic factors included female sex, multifocality, and
regional lymph node involvement.<Reference refidx="16"/>

This led to an international multi-institutional validation of age 55 years as a cutoff for risk stratification in the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) staging system for well-differentiated thyroid cancer. This analysis of 9,484 patients was responsible for the change in age cutoff from 45 years  to 55 years in the <Emphasis>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual</Emphasis>, 8th edition, using AJCC/UICC staging for well-differentiated thyroid cancer.<Reference refidx="22"/> </Para><Para id="_630">  The prognostic significance of lymph node status is controversial.  Use of sentinel lymph node biopsy may aid in identifying patients with occult metastases who might benefit from central neck dissection.<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_430">Diffuse, intense
immunostaining for vascular endothelial growth factor in patients with
papillary cancer has been associated with a high rate of local recurrence and
distant metastases.<Reference refidx="24"/>  An elevated serum thyroglobulin level correlates
strongly with recurrent tumor when found in patients with differentiated
thyroid cancer during postoperative evaluations.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/>  Serum thyroglobulin
levels are most sensitive when patients are hypothyroid and have elevated serum

Cancer</Title><SummarySection id="_437"><Title>Clinical Features and Prognosis</Title><Para id="_438">The clinical features and prognosis of well-differentiated thyroid tumors vary by stage.</Para><Para id="_597">Most papillary cancers have some follicular elements. These follicular elements may outnumber the papillary formations, but they do not
change the prognosis.  </Para><Para id="_598">Follicular adenomas, which are characterized by their lack of invasion through
the capsule into the surrounding thyroid tissue, must be distinguished from follicular thyroid carcinoma. While follicular cancer has a good prognosis, it
is less favorable than that of papillary carcinoma.  The 10-year survival is better for
patients with follicular carcinoma without vascular invasion than it is for
patients with vascular invasion.</Para><Para id="_599">Papillary carcinomas metastasize more frequently to regional lymph nodes than
to distant sites. Follicular carcinomas more commonly invade blood vessels and metastasize hematogenously to the lungs and to the bone rather than through the
lymphatic system.  When metastases occur, treatment with radioiodine is initially effective, but prognosis worsens as resistance to radioiodine ensues. 
</Para><Para id="_633">Staging and prognosis of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer are determined by the patient's age and site of the disease.  Patients with papillary thyroid cancer have the following clinical features and prognoses:</Para><ItemizedList id="_439" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem><Strong>Stage I papillary or follicular thyroid cancer </Strong>is localized to the thyroid gland in patients aged 55 years or older. In those younger than 55 years, the cancer may have spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes but not to other parts of the body. In as many as 50% of the cases, papillary thyroid cancer is multifocal. 
</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Stage II papillary or follicular thyroid cancer</Strong> is defined by either of the following descriptions: (1) patients are younger than 55 years and the  tumor has spread from the thyroid to distant parts of the body, or (2) patients are aged 55 years or older: and the  tumor is confined to or has limited invasion outside of the thyroid, with or without lymph node involvement, but without spread to distant parts of the body. Stage II is the most advanced stage possible in a patient younger than 55 years.    </ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Stage III papillary or follicular thyroid cancer</Strong> is only possible in patients aged 55 years or older.  The thyroid tumor demonstrates extension into surrounding soft tissues, larynx, trachea, esophagus, or recurrent laryngeal nerve. There may or may not be lymph node involvement, but there is no distant spread to other parts of the body. </ListItem><ListItem><Strong>	Stage IVA papillary or follicular thyroid cancer</Strong> is only applicable for patients aged 55 years or older.  The thyroid tumor demonstrates extension into surrounding soft tissues that includes either prevertebral fascia or encases the carotid artery or mediastinal vessels. There may or may not be lymph node involvement, but there is no distant spread to other parts of the body.</ListItem><ListItem>	<Strong>Stage IVB papillary or follicular thyroid cancer</Strong> is only applicable for patients aged 55 years or older.

sporadic and hereditary.  In sporadic MTC, the tumor is usually unilateral. 
In the hereditary form, the tumor is almost always bilateral.  In addition, hereditary MTC may be associated with benign or malignant tumors of other
endocrine organs, commonly referred to as the multiple endocrine neoplasia
(MEN) syndromes types 2A and 2B (MEN2A or MEN2B).
These syndromes are associated with pheochromocytoma of the adrenal
gland and parathyroid hyperplasia.</Para><Para id="_716">Approximately 25% of reported MTC cases are hereditary. 
Hereditary MTC syndromes include MEN2A, which is
the most common, MEN2B, and hereditary non-MEN syndromes.  Any patient with a
hereditary variant is screened for other associated endocrine tumors,
particularly parathyroid hyperplasia and pheochromocytoma.  Medullary carcinoma usually secretes
calcitonin, a hormonal marker for the tumor, and may be detectable in blood
even when the tumor is clinically occult.  Measuring calcitonin
levels is useful for diagnostic purposes and for following the results of treatment. For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000813377" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/men2-hp-pdq">Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 (MEN2)</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_717">Patients with MTC (whether hereditary or sporadic) are
tested for <GeneName>RET</GeneName> pathogenic variants, and if <GeneName>RET</GeneName> variants are detected, family members will
also be tested.  Family members may be screened for calcitonin elevation and the <GeneName>RET</GeneName>
proto-oncogene variant. These tests can identify others at risk of developing
hereditary MTC. Because a  modest elevation of calcitonin may lead to a false-positive diagnosis of MTC, genetic testing for the <GeneName>RET</GeneName> pathogenic variant is
the optimal approach.  Family members who carry the <GeneName>RET</GeneName> pathogenic variant may choose to undergo
prophylactic thyroidectomy at an early age.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_492"><Title>Clinical Features  and Prognosis</Title><Para id="_493">MTC accounts for 3% to 4% of all thyroid cancers.
