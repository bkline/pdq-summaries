This summary currently focuses on MEN1, MEN2, MEN4, familial PHEO and PGL syndrome, Carney-Stratakis (CSS) syndrome, and familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC).  Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Cowden syndrome, and von Hippel-Lindau disease are discussed in the following PDQ summaries:  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062855" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq">Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers</SummaryRef>, <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Genetics of Colorectal Cancer</SummaryRef>, and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000803496" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/vhl-syndrome-hp-pdq">von Hippel-Lindau Disease</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_840"> The term <Strong>multiple endocrine neoplasia</Strong>  is used to describe a group of heritable tumors in endocrine tissues, which can be benign or malignant.  Multiple endocrine neoplasias are typically classified into two main categories:   MEN1 (also known as Wermer syndrome) and MEN2.    Historically, MEN2 was further divided into three subtypes based on the presence or absence of certain endocrine tumors in an individual or family: MEN2A, familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC), and MEN2B (which is sometimes referred to as MEN3). FMTC is now considered a subtype of MEN2A.<Reference refidx="1"/> MEN4 was described as a novel syndrome in humans in 2011. Major characteristics of MEN4 include primary hyperparathyroidism and pituitary adenomas. MEN syndrome–associated  tumors usually manifest as the overproduction of hormones, tumor growth, or both.

One study of 560 individuals with MEN1 showed a significant delay between the time of the first presenting symptom and the diagnosis of MEN1.<Reference refidx="36"/> This time lapse is likely because some presenting symptoms of MEN1-associated tumors, such as amenorrhea, peptic ulcers, hypoglycemia, and nephrolithiasis, are not specific to MEN1.</Para><Para id="_812">Furthermore, identification of an MEN1-associated tumor  is not sufficient to make the clinical diagnosis of MEN1 and may not trigger a referral to an endocrinologist. The median time between the first presenting symptom and diagnosis of MEN1 ranges from 7.6 years to 12 years.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="31"/> Genetic testing alleviates some of this delay. Several studies have shown statistically significant differences in the age at MEN1 diagnosis between <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460211" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">probands</GlossaryTermRef> and their family members. In one study, clinically symptomatic probands were diagnosed with MEN1 at a mean age of 47.5 years (standard deviation [SD] +/- 13.5 y), while family members were diagnosed at a mean age of 38.5 years (SD +/- 15.4 y; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001).<Reference refidx="36"/> In another study of 154 individuals with MEN1, probands were diagnosed at a mean age of 39.5 years (range: 18–74 y), compared with  a mean age of 27 years (range: 14–56 y; <Emphasis>P &lt;</Emphasis> .05) in family members diagnosed by predictive genetic testing.<Reference refidx="37"/> Nonetheless, the lag time between the diagnosis of MEN1 in an index case and the diagnosis of MEN1 in family members can be significant, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.<Reference refidx="38"/> This was demonstrated in a Dutch MEN1 Study Group analysis, which showed that 10% to 38% of non-index cases already had an MEN1-related manifestation at diagnosis; 4% of these individuals died of an MEN1-related cause that developed during or before the lag time.

This is especially crucial, since many of the above conditions have different management guidelines that correspond with their features. For example, distinguishing between MEN1 and FHH can be critical for a patient's disease management. Removing the parathyroid glands in FHH does not correct the hyperparathyroidism that is seen in patients with MEN1. This could result in an unnecessary surgery that would not relieve the patient's symptoms. In addition, HPT-JT is unique because it increases parathyroid carcinoma risk.

However, ongoing studies have evaluated the role of MRI in functional imaging, including gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE (68Ga-DOTATATE) positron emission tomography (PET)–computed tomography (CT) scanning. A  multicenter retrospective study examined 108 MEN1 patients undergoing PET-CT for screening, staging, restaging, or targeted radiotherapy selection. This study demonstrated that PET-CT has the potential to increase diagnostic sensitivity when searching for MEN1-associated NETs.<Reference refidx="73"/>  In 51% of cases, PET-CT provided superior lesion detection when compared with conventional imaging techniques. However, the retrospective nature of the study makes it impossible to discern how much selection bias may have impacted the study's findings. Consequently,  PET-CT's exact role in detecting  metastasis remains unclear. PET-CT's potentially improved diagnostic sensitivity must also be weighed against its increased levels of  radiation exposure, which are  higher than that of other imaging modalities. Radiation exposure is particularly relevant for MEN1 patients, who are prone to developing aggressive malignancies. The issue is even more nuanced in  young patients who require lifelong screening to detect aggressive MEN1-associated malignancies early.</Para><Para id="_1702">A study analyzed thoracic screening techniques in 50 patients with MEN1. It found that when patients with MEN1 underwent functional imaging with fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET-CT  screening, they had  a similar number of lung nodules as individuals in  the general population. However, when  lesions  in MEN1 patients were FDG-avid, they were more likely to progress during the follow-up period. Therefore, further observation and follow up of FDG-avid lesions may be warranted in patients with MEN1.<Reference refidx="74"/> While lung-specific imaging is not routinely performed in MEN1 patients, the lungs are visualized during MRI surveillance of thymic lesions. When pulmonary lesions are identified, it is important to recognize that lung NETs may  grow slowly and may have a good prognosis.

However, the timing and the amount of parathyroid and thymus gland tissue that is removed during surgery remains controversial.<Reference refidx="40"/> For patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who are at risk for MEN1, preoperative detection of a pathogenic variant helps guide the extent of their initial operations, can increase the likelihood of successful initial surgeries, and lower the likelihood of recurrent disease.<Reference refidx="68"/> Furthermore, knowledge of an <GeneName>MEN1</GeneName> pathogenic variant can help guide surgical decision making and avoid the use of a single-gland surgical approach. Studies have shown that concomitant bilateral cervical thymectomy decreases the rate of parathyroid tumor recurrence and  suggests that the thymus can be removed during the patient's initial operation.<Reference refidx="80"/></Para><Para id="_1808">Some groups reserve surgical intervention for symptomatic patients, with continued annual biochemical screening for those without  objective signs of disease. Subtotal parathyroidectomy (removal of 3–3.5 glands) is commonly suggested as the initial surgical treatment when a provider decides to proceed with surgery.<Reference refidx="68"/> If 3.5 or more glands are removed during surgery, the rate of persistent disease is only 5% to 6%. Removing fewer than 3.5 glands decreases the durability of eucalcemia. Studies suggest that preoperative imaging (to determine which glands are hyperfunctional) is not reliable enough to justify unilateral exploration, with 86% of patients having enlarged contralateral parathyroid glands.<Reference refidx="81"/> Fifty percent of the patients who had imaging to direct resection had the largest parathyroid gland identified intraoperatively on the contralateral side of greatest uptake.<Reference refidx="81"/>  Insufficient resection fails to accomplish the desired eucalcemia.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="68"/> </Para><Para id="_1828">Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue to a distant site, such as the forearm, is a less commonly recommended option. Likelihood of cancer recurrence is lowered with total parathyroidectomy. However, this procedure also renders the patient aparathyroid for a period of time while the autotransplanted tissue becomes functional. This can cause a permanent PTH deficiency (no detectable PTH in the body).<Reference refidx="80"/><Reference refidx="82"/> Benefits of this approach include the following: 1) it is easier remove/debulk recurrent disease from the forearm than it is to remove/debulk recurrent disease from the neck, and 2) differential lateralization with arm blood draws.  Hypocalcemia management involves taking numerous oral medications, including calcitrol and calcium replacement, and these daily requirements can be a major burden for patients. Recovery was less likely for patients who were aparathyroid for  6 months after total parathyroidectomy.<Reference refidx="83"/>   In select high-risk patients, like in those who had reoperative parathyroidectomy or cervical surgery, cryopreservation can be beneficial,  but it is recommended that providers use this method sparingly.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_804"><Title>Treatment for duodenopancreatic NETs</Title><Para id="_882">The timing and extent of surgery for duodenopancreatic NETs are controversial and depend on many factors, including severity of symptoms, extent of disease, functional component, location and necessity of simple enucleation, subtotal or total pancreatectomy, and pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure).

A less common but important risk of death  is from malignant thymic carcinoid tumors.   Indicators of a poor MEN1 prognosis include elevated fasting serum gastrin, the presence of functional hormonal syndromes,  liver or distant metastases, aggressive  duodenopancreatic NET growth,  large  duodenopancreatic NET size,  or the need for multiple parathyroidectomies.

These tumors are typically multifocal and cause hyper-secretion of gastrin, with resultant peptic ulcer disease (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome).<Reference refidx="113"/> The multifocal nature makes complete surgical resection difficult. It is critical to manage symptoms before considering any type of surgical intervention.<Reference refidx="114"/> Historically, some groups have recommended close observation of individuals with smaller tumors (&lt;2.0 cm on imaging) who have relief of symptoms using medications (e.g., proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 agonists);<Reference refidx="115"/> however, this approach may not be optimal for all patients.</Para><Para id="_884">Several published series have shown a positive correlation between primary tumor size and rate of distant metastasis.

A Whipple procedure is typically discouraged as an initial surgery, given the high postoperative morbidity and long-term complications, such as diabetes mellitus and malabsorption. Less extensive operations have been described with varying results. At a minimum, duodenectomy with intraoperative palpation and/or ultrasonography to locate and excise duodenal tumors and peri-pancreatic lymph node dissection are  performed.<Reference refidx="101"/><Reference refidx="117"/> Because most patients with gastrinoma will have concomitant NETs throughout the pancreas, some of which may be nonfunctional, some groups recommend resection of the distal pancreas and enucleation of tumors in the pancreatic head in addition to duodenal tumor excision.<Reference refidx="101"/><Reference refidx="117"/><Reference refidx="118"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_886"><Title>Nonfunctioning NETs</Title><Para id="_887">Approximately 50% of individuals with MEN1 will develop nonfunctioning NETs.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="26"/> These are often identified incidentally during assessment and exploration for functioning tumors.

Individuals may present with secondary hypertension. In 2004, the World Health Organization characterized adrenal gland tumors as PHEOs.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The term paraganglioma is reserved for non-adrenal (or extra-adrenal) neoplasms and may arise in various sites from the paraganglia along the parasympathetic nerves or the sympathetic trunk.  PGLs may be found in the head and neck region, abdomen, or pelvis.  Only those arising from sympathetic neural chains have secretory capacity.

Although many PGLs do not secrete catecholamines, chromogranin A has been found to be elevated in PGLs and may be a useful marker for tumor recurrence.  The appropriate screening imaging modality is unknown at this time, but fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) is highly sensitive at identifying extra-adrenal PGLs and GISTs.  Because of the risks of ionizing radiation exposure from CT, some suggest using MRI for annual surveillance.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>  </Para><Para id="_1096"><LOERef href="CDR0000531827" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: 4</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_976"><Title>Interventions</Title><Para id="_992">Because multiple primary GISTs and PGLs are common with CSS, preoperative imaging is paramount to accurately identify the extent of disease before surgical planning.  Most patients will present having already undergone imaging with CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Both methods have excellent sensitivity for identifying PGLs, but additional functional imaging is recommended because of the diffuse nature of these tumors.   18F-FDG PET-CT is superior to iodine I 123-metaiodobenzylguanidine at identifying <GeneName>SDHx</GeneName>-associated PGLs and, because of the high metabolic activity of GISTs, has excellent sensitivity in identifying them.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="17"/>  Thus, in patients with <GeneName>SDHx</GeneName> pathogenic variants, including those with CSS, 18F-FDG PET-CT is the preferred functional imaging modality to optimally detect and stage all GISTs and PGLs.<Reference refidx="16"/>  Some evidence suggests that  fluorine F 18-fluorohydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) PET-CT is superior at identifying the primary PGL, while 18F-FDG PET-CT is superior at identifying metastases.  </Para><Para id="_993">There are no prospective treatment studies involving patients with CSS; therefore, recommendations are based on limited clinical experience, single case series, and extrapolations from genetically-similar tumors with similar clinical behavior.  The mainstay of treatment for CSS-associated GISTs and PGLs is complete surgical resection of the tumor. The timing of the operation correlates with the presentation of the tumor. Surgical resection can be accomplished with laparoscopic or open techniques.  For PGLs, vascular reconstruction is uncommon.  Although PGLs are commonly present in the paraaortic region, the need for major vascular reconstruction is uncommon. GIST tumors can be resected with wedge resection and primary closure and re-anastomosis.  Ensuring negative margins is important, as patients for whom a complete resection is accomplished experience the longest survival.<Reference refidx="18"/>   In the rare setting of synchronous disease, combined resection is appropriate if tolerable by the patient.   More commonly, tumors develop metachronously, with GISTs arising first; individual resection occurs at the time of diagnosis of each tumor.  </Para><Para id="_995">A thorough preoperative endoscopy and complete surgical exploration of the stomach are essential, as multiple separate GISTs are frequently encountered. The high frequency of multifocality and the likelihood of tumor recurrence do not justify a prophylactic total gastrectomy because of its substantial associated morbidity. Furthermore, a total gastrectomy is generally only performed when the current disease burden precludes a lesser resection.  To this end, gastric wedge resection with gross negative margins is the surgical goal.<Reference refidx="19"/>  Sampling of any suspicious nodes at the time of resection is commonly performed.  Evidence suggests that locally advanced CSS-associated GISTs demonstrate a rather indolent course;<Reference refidx="20"/> thus, the concern for nodal involvement based on preoperative imaging or abdominal exploration need not deter resection of the primary tumor.  While a role for neoadjuvant imatinib in locally advanced adult-type GISTs has been widely described to improve resectability or reduce the burden of resection, it is unlikely to have any effect in locally advanced SDH-deficient GISTs.<Reference refidx="21"/>  Evidence suggests that for these tumors, the second-line targeted agents, including sorafenib, sunitinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, may be beneficial in the adjuvant setting.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/>  No data support using these agents in the neoadjuvant setting at this time.</Para><Para id="_996">Regarding treatment of CSS-associated PGLs,  patients are commonly initiated on alpha-blockade preoperatively to minimize perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality.  PGLs typically occur in the para-aortic chain from the urinary bladder and the aortic bifurcation to the superior mediastinum and head and neck.  As in the treatment of GISTs, the operative goal is resection of all known disease.   Preoperative imaging and intra-operative exploration are essential to achieving this goal.  Multiple tumors are common; when disease is present in the bilateral adrenal glands, the surgeon faces the possibility of rendering a patient steroid dependent with a lifelong risk of a fatal  Addisonian crisis.  In this setting, a surgeon proficient in performing a cortical-sparing adrenalectomy may be consulted.</Para><Para id="_1026"><LOERef href="CDR0000531846" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: 5</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="11857563">Carney JA, Stratakis CA: Familial paraganglioma and gastric stromal sarcoma: a new syndrome distinct from the Carney triad.

The group also detected this variant through next-generation sequencing in 4.7% of NMTC cases from the Cancer Genome Atlas. This variant was associated with increased HAPB2 protein expression in the thyroid neoplasms of affected family members. This was not seen in normal thyroid tissue or in individuals with sporadic PTC. Functional G534E studies showed that this variant increased colony formation and cellular migration, suggesting a loss of tumor suppression function. Notably, the authors used a criterion of general population frequency of 1% or less to filter variants identified in this kindred using the 1000 Genomes Project (phase III) and HapMap3. However, subsequent correspondences commented on higher reported frequencies of G534E variants from public databases including that of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) (2.22% in the total population, 3.29% in non-Finnish European individuals) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Grand Opportunity Exome Sequencing Project database (5.5% in the total population, 3.88% in American individuals of European descent).<Reference refidx="51"/><Reference refidx="52"/><Reference refidx="53"/> Many additional studies were conducted to ascertain the frequency of <GeneName>HAPB2</GeneName> G534E in FNMTC with variable results. While the G534E variant was not identified in 12 Chinese FNMTC families with PTC (nor in 217 patients with sporadic PTC) <Reference refidx="53"/> or in 11 Middle Eastern FNMTC family members,<Reference refidx="54"/> it was shown to segregate in several independent FNMTC kindreds with PTC from a United States study.<Reference refidx="55"/> Several other studies showed that the G534E variant was found in controls and sporadic cases just as often, or more often, than it was found in familial cases of PTC (if the variant was identified in familial PTC cohorts at all). In some cases, the G534E variant did not segregate with disease in familial PTC cohorts.<Reference refidx="54"/><Reference refidx="56"/><Reference refidx="57"/><Reference refidx="58"/> Therefore, it seems that the <GeneName>HAPB2</GeneName> G534E variant frequency differs among ancestries and populations; this variant was present in low-to-moderate levels in individuals of European ancestry and in low levels, or completely absent, in individuals of Asian and Middle Eastern ancestries.

Specifically, the V205M (c.613G&gt;C) variant in <GeneName>RTFC</GeneName> was important because it was identified in FNMTC patients but absent in unaffected controls. Two additional oncogenic <GeneName>RTFC</GeneName> variants were identified (R115Q and G209D) in patients with sporadic NMTC. Collectively, the ExAC frequencies of these variants in East Asian populations are higher than the ExAC frequencies in the total population, which may indicate that this gene is most relevant in East Asian families with FNMTC. Larger validation studies of this gene and these variants need to be conducted.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><Para id="_1544">In summary, although multiple susceptibility loci have been identified in FNMTC families, no single locus accounts for the majority of nonsyndromic FNMTC and no gene identified shows strong enough associations to warrant clinical genetic testing.

Identifying susceptibility genes will allow for screening and early diagnosis, which in turn would lead to improved outcomes for patients and families.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1065"><Title>Surveillance</Title><Para id="_1572">Differentiated thyroid cancer, whether inherited or sporadic, may be associated with a high rate of recurrence, depending on the clinicopathologic features of the disease.  Disease recurrence may occur as late as 40 years after initial diagnosis.<Reference refidx="59"/>  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000496506" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">Surveillance</GlossaryTermRef> for recurrent disease therefore plays an important role in the long-term management of patients with these tumors.  The optimal follow-up strategy is dependent upon both the initial tumor characteristics and the patient's response to therapy.<Reference refidx="60"/>  Fortunately, for most patients, the disease is associated with a low risk of recurrence, and surveillance is accordingly less intensive.  In these cases, postoperative evaluation is centered on sonographic examination of the neck and measurement of serum thyroglobulin.<Reference refidx="60"/></Para><Para id="_1573">Thyroglobulin, a protein produced by both benign and malignant thyroid follicular cells, is used as a tumor marker for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.  Thyroglobulin measurement is most sensitive after a total thyroidectomy, so detection of thyroglobulin—particularly an increasing trend in the serum concentration—is often an early indicator of recurrent or progressive disease.<Reference refidx="61"/>  However, it is important to recognize several caveats about the use of this tumor marker.  It is imperative to assess serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroglobulin antibody levels concomitantly at each measurement.  Thyroglobulin rises with increasing TSH values; therefore, an elevating thyroglobulin level could indicate progressive disease or simply a rising TSH level.  Furthermore, the presence of thyroglobulin antibodies can interfere with the accurate measurement of thyroglobulin, with most cases resulting in a spurious lowering of the tumor marker.<Reference refidx="62"/> In such cases, the antibody titer may be used as a surrogate marker of disease status.<Reference refidx="60"/>  The final caveat about the use of thyroglobulin as a tumor marker is that the test must be performed in the same laboratory at each measurement to accurately assess the trend in levels; each assay can render a different value of thyroglobulin on the same serum sample.<Reference refidx="60"/>  Measurement of serum thyroglobulin to assess for recurrent or persistent disease may be performed 3 to 6 months after therapy is completed and monitored periodically thereafter, depending on the concern for persistent or recurrent disease.<Reference refidx="60"/> Stimulated thyroglobulin testing (after withdrawal of thyroid hormone reaches a minimum TSH level of 30 mIU/L or after recombinant TSH injection) may be useful in select patients, particularly in patients with follicular thyroid cancer or in whom there is high clinical suspicion of recurrent or residual disease.</Para><Para id="_1574">Whether a patient has received radioactive iodine or only surgery, careful ultrasonography of all compartments in the anterior neck is an important tool to determine if there is recurrent or residual disease because most disease is localized in this region. The initial ultrasonography is typically performed 6 to 12 months after surgery.<Reference refidx="60"/>  Ultrasonography may be performed sooner if there is concern about residual disease, but it is important for the sonographer to recognize the potential for false-positive findings due to postoperative swelling.  The timing and need for subsequent sonographic evaluation of the neck is dependent upon the patient’s risk for recurrence and the serum thyroglobulin status.<Reference refidx="60"/></Para><Para id="_1575">Ultrasonography combined with a serum thyroglobulin test has a very high <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322883" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">sensitivity</GlossaryTermRef> for identifying nodal disease, far superior to the radioiodine diagnostic whole-body scans that were historically the mainstay of surveillance.<Reference refidx="61"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1066"><Title>Interventions</Title><Para id="_1546">Once a thyroid nodule is detected, further work-up includes complete ultrasonography of the thyroid, as well as a comprehensive neck ultrasonography to evaluate the central and lateral neck lymph nodes.

Those nodules with less suspicious sonographic features may be considered for FNA at a larger size threshold.  Nodules smaller than 10 mm in greatest dimension may still warrant cytologic evaluation if radiographic imaging demonstrates features concerning for malignancy, such as suspicious lymphadenopathy or extrathyroidal extension. Consideration may also be given to perform FNA of sonographically suspicious nodules, regardless of size, for patients with a strong family history of thyroid cancer.  Ultrasonographic features suspicious for malignancy include hypoechogenicity, solid composition, taller-than-wide shape, infiltrative borders, and microcalcifications. </Para><Para id="_1755">Although positron emission tomography scanning is not recommended for thyroid nodule assessment, concentrated uptake of contrast in the thyroid gland may be detected when the scan is obtained for other reasons.  Incidental increase in fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose avidity, and an increase in nodule size (more than 50% volume) during surveillance may also be indications for FNA biopsy of nodules.<Reference refidx="60"/></Para><SummarySection id="_1547"><Title>Cytologic evaluation and indeterminate thyroid nodules</Title><Para id="_1548">The Bethesda Thyroid Cytology Classification standardizes the cytologic interpretation of thyroid biopsies.

Nodules classified as AUS/FLUS fall into the indeterminate category because the extent of architectural or cytologic atypia excludes a benign diagnosis, but the degree of atypia is insufficient for a definitive malignant classification.<Reference refidx="66"/>  These lesions may be considered for repeat FNA, surveillance ultrasonography, molecular testing, or surgical removal on the basis  of clinical concern for malignancy, comorbid conditions, and/or family history of thyroid cancer.<Reference refidx="60"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1549"><Title>Surgical treatment of thyroid cancer</Title><Para id="_1550">Patients with a diagnosis of FNMTC may have increased aggressiveness of disease in comparison with sporadic cases.<Reference refidx="67"/>  If there are three affected members of a kindred, the tumor is more likely to have aggressive features at a younger age; this suggests a more aggressive surgical management may be warranted.<Reference refidx="68"/>  Most experts support total thyroidectomy because of the risk of increased frequency of multicentric disease, lymph node metastases, local invasion, and recurrence of aggressive disease.<Reference refidx="67"/><Reference refidx="69"/> Most surgeons would agree that patients with FNMTC and radiographically, clinically, or intraoperatively suspicious or biopsy-proven metastatic lymph nodes warrant total thyroidectomy and therapeutic compartment-based removal of the lymph node basin(s).  Controversy exists, however, as to the appropriate treatment of nonenlarged lymph nodes of the central neck at the time of initial thyroidectomy.  Specifically, some groups advocate routine prophylactic central node dissection (PCND) for all patients with known FNMTC to decrease the risk of local recurrence, although there are no specific, prospective, randomized data to support a survival benefit.<Reference refidx="70"/><Reference refidx="71"/> While two retrospective studies (not specific to hereditary thyroid cancer) have reported a reduction in disease recurrence rates associated with PCND,<Reference refidx="72"/><Reference refidx="73"/> two meta-analyses have shown that PCND does not reduce recurrence rates in a clinically significant manner.<Reference refidx="74"/><Reference refidx="75"/> The current recommendations published by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) state that prophylactic or bilateral Level VI lymph node dissection is recommended in patients with T3/T4 papillary cancer (whether familial or not), clinically involved lateral neck nodes or if the information will be used to plan further therapy such as radioactive iodine ablation. The ATA also states that this recommendation should be interpreted in light of available surgical expertise, acknowledging that PCND may lead to increased perioperative morbidity.<Reference refidx="60"/>  Currently, selective, rather than routine PCND seems the most reasonable option to guide the decision process.<Reference refidx="76"/></Para><Para id="_1551">After total thyroidectomy, patients will need lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.<Reference refidx="60"/>  The levothyroxine replacement therapy dose is approximately 1.6 µg/kg/day and is then titrated to reach an appropriate level of TSH suppression.<Reference refidx="77"/><Reference refidx="78"/>  The degree of TSH suppression is also individualized on the basis of the patient’s disease status, risk of recurrence, an individual's risk of cardiovascular and bone complications with aggressive TSH suppression,<Reference refidx="60"/> and clinicopathological tumor features.  Patients typically undergo a surveillance regimen for recurrence consisting of laboratory evaluation and ultrasonography.  In papillary and follicular cancer, thyroxine and TSH demonstrate the level of thyroid suppression, and thyroglobulin and thyroglobulin antibody levels are important markers for possible disease recurrence or metastases.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="24557566">Davies L, Welch HG: Current thyroid cancer trends in the United States.
