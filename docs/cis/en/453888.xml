The people are divided into groups, called cohorts, based on  whether or not they  have had a certain treatment or been exposed to certain things. In cohort studies, the information is collected and studied after certain outcomes (such as cancer or death) have occurred.  For example, a cohort study might follow a group of women who have regular Pap tests, and divide  them into those who test positive for the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045714" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">human papillomavirus</GlossaryTermRef> (HPV) and those who test negative for HPV.

In case-control studies, information is collected from cases (people who already have a certain disease) and compared with information collected from controls (people who do not have the disease).

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
