One statistic that is commonly used in making a prognosis is the 5-year <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044296" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">relative survival rate</GlossaryTermRef>. The 5-year relative survival rate tells you what percent of people with the same type and stage of bladder cancer are alive 5 years after their cancer was diagnosed, compared with people in the overall population. For example, the 5-year relative survival rate for localized bladder cancer is 71%. This means that people diagnosed with localized bladder cancer are 71% as likely as someone who does not have bladder cancer to be alive 5 years after diagnosis.</Para><Para id="_12">The 5-year relative survival rates for bladder cancer are as follows:</Para><ItemizedList id="_13" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>97% for carcinoma in situ of the bladder alone (abnormal cells found in the tissue lining the inside of the bladder)</ListItem><ListItem>71% for localized bladder cancer (cancer is in the bladder only)</ListItem><ListItem>39% for regional bladder cancer (cancer has spread beyond the bladder to nearby lymph nodes or organs)</ListItem><ListItem>8% for metastatic bladder cancer (cancer has spread beyond the bladder to a distant part of the body)</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_14"><ExternalRef xref="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/urinb.html">Learn more about statistics for bladder cancer from our Cancer Stat Facts Collection.</ExternalRef></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_15"><Title>Understanding survival rate statistics</Title><Para id="_16">Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to you. The doctor who knows the most about your situation is in the best position to discuss these statistics and talk with you about your prognosis. It is important to note the following when reviewing survival statistics:</Para><ItemizedList id="_17" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>No two people are entirely alike, and responses to treatment can vary greatly.</ListItem><ListItem>Survival statistics use information collected from large groups of people who may have received different types of treatment.</ListItem><ListItem>It takes several years to see the effect of newer and better treatments, so these effects may not be reflected in current survival statistics.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_18">To learn more about survival statistics and to see videos of patients and their doctors exploring their feelings about prognosis, see <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/prognosis">Understanding Cancer Prognosis</ExternalRef>.</Para></SummarySection><DateFirstPublished>2023-02-16</DateFirstPublished><DateLastModified>2023-04-27</DateLastModified></Summary>
