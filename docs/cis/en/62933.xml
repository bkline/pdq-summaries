When initial treatment approaches for children were modeled after those used for adults, substantial morbidities resulted from unacceptably high radiation doses.  As a result, strategies using chemotherapy and lower-dose radiation were developed. Presently,  treatment approaches for pediatric and adult patients are merging, focusing on improving outcomes while reducing late effects in both populations.</Para><Para id="_1826">  Approximately 90% to 95%  of children and adolescents with Hodgkin  lymphoma can be cured, prompting increased attention to therapy that lessens long-term morbidity. Contemporary treatment programs use a risk-based and response-adapted approach in which patients receive multiagent chemotherapy,  with or without   low-dose involved-field or involved-site radiation therapy. 




 Prognostic factors used to determine chemotherapy intensity include cancer stage, presence or absence of B symptoms (fever, weight loss, and night sweats), bulky disease, extranodal involvement, and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_420"><Title>Epidemiology</Title><Para id="_163">Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for 6.5% of childhood cancers.    In the United States, the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma is age related and is highest among adolescents aged 15 to 19 years (31.2 cases per 1 million per year). Children aged 10 to 14 years, 5 to 9 years, and 0 to 4 years have approximately threefold, tenfold, and 30-fold lower rates of Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively,  than do older adolescents.<Reference refidx="2"/>  In low-income countries, the incidence rate is similar in young adults but much higher in children.<Reference refidx="3"/> </Para><Para id="_705">Hodgkin lymphoma has the following unique epidemiological features:</Para><ItemizedList id="_669" Style="bullet"><ListItem><Strong>Bimodal age distribution. </Strong>Bimodal age distribution differs geographically and ethnically. In industrialized countries, the early peak occurs in the middle-to-late 20s and the second peak after age 50 years. In low-income countries, the early peak occurs before adolescence.<Reference refidx="4"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Male-to-female ratio. </Strong>This ratio varies markedly by age. In children younger than 10 years, the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma is threefold higher in males than in females. In children aged 10 to 14 years, the incidence is approximately 1.2-fold higher in males than in females. In adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, the incidence is similar for males and females.<Reference refidx="2"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Age cohorts. </Strong>Hodgkin lymphoma can be segregated into the following three age cohorts because of the variation in etiologies and histological subtypes (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062933#_1813" url="/types/lymphoma/hp/child-hodgkin-treatment-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>):<ItemizedList id="_670" Style="dash"><ListItem><Strong>Children:</Strong> More males than females are affected in the youngest age cohort, especially in children younger than 10 years.<Para id="_2040">Individuals aged 14 years and younger have a higher prevalence of the non-classical nodular lymphocyte-predominant disease (NLPHL) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–associated mixed-cellularity disease.

The risk in sisters was higher than the risk in brothers or siblings of opposite sex. The lifetime risk of Hodgkin lymphoma was higher when first-degree relatives were diagnosed before age 30 years.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Genetic susceptibility.</Strong> A study of twins affected by Hodgkin lymphoma showed that monozygotic twins, but not dizygotic twins, have a greatly increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma (standardized incidence ratio of approximately 100). This finding supports the idea that genetic susceptibility underlies Hodgkin lymphoma.<Reference refidx="11"/> A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identified 18 risk loci for Hodgkin lymphoma, further validating the major role of genetic susceptibility. Genes putatively associated with the risk loci affected three general biological processes: germinal center reaction, T-cell differentiation and function, and constitutive nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells activation.<Reference refidx="12"/><Para id="_2073">A comprehensive whole genome sequencing effort was conducted in 234 individuals with and without Hodgkin lymphoma, selected from 36 pedigrees that had two or more affected first-degree relatives.<Reference refidx="13"/> Using linkage and a tiered variant prioritization algorithm, 44 Hodgkin lymphoma pathogenic risk variants were identified (33 coding variants and 11 noncoding variants). A recurrent coding variant was seen in <GeneName>KDR</GeneName>, and a 5’ untranslated region variant was seen in <GeneName>KLHDC8B</GeneName>—both of which have previously been identified. Two new noncoding variants were seen in <GeneName>PAX5</GeneName> (intron 5) and <GeneName>GATA3</GeneName> (intron 3). In addition, multiple unrelated families harbored novel loss of function variants in <GeneName>POLR1E</GeneName> and stop-gain variants in <GeneName>IRF7</GeneName> and <GeneName>EEF2KMT</GeneName>. These findings validated previous studies and identified additional germline pathogenic variants associated with an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma.</Para></ListItem></ItemizedList><Table id="_1813"><Title>Table 1.

These cells are in a background of inflammatory cells consisting of small lymphocytes, histiocytes, epithelioid histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, plasma cells, and fibroblasts. The inflammatory cells are present in different proportions depending on the histological subtype.
