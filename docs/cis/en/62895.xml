the selection differences among series.  Effusions, both pleural and

both (biphasic).  Desmoplastic mesothelioma, consisting of bland tumor cells between dense bands of stroma, is a subtype of sarcomatoid mesothelioma. The epithelioid form is occasionally confused with lung adenocarcinoma or metastatic carcinomas.  Epithelioid tumors account for approximately 60% of mesothelioma diagnoses.<Reference refidx="1"/> Attempts to diagnose by
cytology or needle biopsy of the pleura are often unsuccessful.  It can be
especially difficult to differentiate mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma in small
tissue specimens.  Thoracoscopy can be valuable in obtaining adequate tissue
specimens for diagnostic purposes.<Reference refidx="2"/>  
</Para><Para id="_151">Examination of the gross tumor at
surgery and use of special stains or electron microscopy can often help to  determine diagnosis.  Pancytokeratin stains are positive in nearly all mesotheliomas.<Reference refidx="1"/> Cytokeratin 5 and 6, calretinin, WT-1, and D2-40 are particularly useful immunohistochemical stains for  the differential diagnosis of epithelioid mesothelioma. Calretinin and D2-40 positivity in combination with pancytokeratin positivity is most useful to  distinguish sarcomatoid mesothelioma from sarcoma and  other histologies.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Histological
appearance seems to be of prognostic value, and  most clinical studies
show that patients with epithelial mesotheliomas have a better prognosis than  patients with sarcomatoid or biphasic mesotheliomas.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Travis W, Brambilla E, Müller-Hermelink H, et al., eds.: Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, and Thymus.
