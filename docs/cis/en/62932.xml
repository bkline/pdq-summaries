The most common types of NSCLC are squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma, but there are several other types that occur less frequently, and all types can occur in unusual histological variants.  Although NSCLCs are associated with cigarette smoke, adenocarcinomas may be found in patients who never smoked. </Para><Para id="_485740">As a class, NSCLC is usually less sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy than SCLC. Patients with resectable disease may be cured by surgery or surgery followed by chemotherapy. Local control can be achieved with radiation therapy in many patients with unresectable disease, but cure is seen in relatively few patients. Patients with locally advanced unresectable disease may achieve long-term survival with radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. Patients with advanced metastatic disease may achieve improved survival and palliation of symptoms with chemotherapy, targeted agents, and other supportive measures.</Para><SummarySection id="_12"><Title>Incidence and Mortality</Title><Para id="_27">Estimated new cases and deaths from lung cancer (NSCLC and SCLC combined) in the United States in 2025:<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_28" Style="bullet"><ListItem>New cases: 226,650.</ListItem><ListItem>Deaths: 124,730.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_29">Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States.

One of the biggest problems with lung adenocarcinomas is the frequent histological heterogeneity. Mixtures of adenocarcinoma histological subtypes are more common than tumors consisting purely of a single pattern of acinar, papillary, bronchioloalveolar, and solid adenocarcinoma with mucin formation. </Para><Para id="_456">Criteria for the diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma have varied widely in the past.

However, the future of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma as a distinct clinical entity is unclear; a multidisciplinary expert panel representing the IASLC, the American Thoracic Society, and the European Respiratory Society proposed a major revision of the classification of adenocarcinomas in 2011 that entails a reclassification of what was called bronchioloalveolar carcinoma into newly defined histological subgroups.</Para><Para id="_458">The following variants of adenocarcinoma are recognized in the WHO/IASLC classification: </Para><ItemizedList id="_453" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma.</ListItem><ListItem>Mucinous (colloid) adenocarcinoma.</ListItem><ListItem>Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.</ListItem><ListItem>Signet ring adenocarcinoma.</ListItem><ListItem>Clear cell adenocarcinoma.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_459"><Title>Large cell carcinoma</Title><Para id="_460">In addition to the general category of large cell carcinoma, several uncommon variants are recognized in the WHO/IASLC classification, including:</Para><ItemizedList id="_461" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC).</ListItem><ListItem>Basaloid carcinoma.</ListItem><ListItem>Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.</ListItem><ListItem>Clear cell carcinoma.</ListItem><ListItem>Large cell carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_462">Basaloid carcinoma is also recognized as a variant of squamous cell carcinoma, and rarely, adenocarcinomas may have a basaloid pattern; however, in tumors without either of these features, they are regarded as a variant of large cell carcinoma. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_468"><Title>Neuroendocrine tumors</Title><Para id="_469">LCNEC is recognized as a histologically high-grade non-small cell carcinoma.

In a few patients, however, multiple microscopic examinations of pleural (pericardial) fluid are negative for tumor, and the fluid is nonbloody and not an exudate. If these elements and clinical judgment dictate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, the effusion should be excluded as a staging descriptor.</entry></Row><Row><entry/><entry>M1b</entry><entry>Single extrathoracic metastases in a single organ (including involvement of a single nonregional node).</entry></Row><Row><entry/><entry>M1c</entry><entry>Multiple extrathoracic metastases in a single organ or in multiple organs.</entry></Row></TBody></TGroup></Table><Table id="_485773"><Title>Table 4.

Postoperative chemotherapy may provide an additional benefit to patients with resected NSCLC.  Radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy can produce a cure in a small number of patients and can provide palliation in most patients.   Prophylactic cranial irradiation may reduce the incidence of brain metastases, but there is no evidence of a survival benefit and the effect of prophylactic cranial irradiation on quality of life is not known.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> In patients with advanced-stage disease, chemotherapy or EGFR kinase inhibitors offer modest

disease-related symptoms in patients with advanced NSCLC.  Several clinical trials have attempted to assess the impact of chemotherapy on tumor-related symptoms and quality of life.

study.
