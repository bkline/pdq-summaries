Pituitary apoplexy can result from an acute hemorrhagic or ischemic infarction of the pituitary in patients harboring often unrecognized secreting or nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. In a series analyzing 40 cases of pituitary apoplexy, the presenting signs and symptoms included headache (63%), vomiting (50%), visual field defects (61%), ocular paresis (40%), mental deterioration (13%), hyponatremia (13%), and syncope (5%). There were only four cases in which the pituitary tumor was diagnosed before the apoplexy presentation.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_283">The development of pituitary adenomas may also occur as a component of one of the following familial cancer syndromes:<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_284" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.</ListItem><ListItem>Carney complex (e.g., cardiac myxomas, spotty skin pigmentation, and tumors of the adrenal gland and anterior pituitary). </ListItem><ListItem>Isolated familial acromegaly.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_177">Other lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sellar masses.

Sellar masses may also result from tumors that are metastatic to the pituitary.  This typically occurs as a part of a generalized metastatic spread and is usually associated with five     or more additional metastatic sites, especially osseous; breast and lung cancer are the most common primary neoplasms metastasizing to the pituitary.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="9861546">Asa SL, Ezzat S: The cytogenesis and pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas.

Tumors are divided into microadenomas (i.e., greatest diameter &lt;10 mm) and macroadenomas (i.e., greatest diameter ≥10 mm).<Reference refidx="3"/>  Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas. Historically, the most widely used radioanatomical classification was based primarily on a neuroradiological examination including skull x-rays, pneumoencephalography, polytomography, and carotid angiography <Reference refidx="4"/> and subsequently validated by more accurate computed tomography (CT)  and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This radioanatomical classification places adenomas into one of five grades (0–IV).<Reference refidx="5"/> For more information, see the  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062915#_3" url="/types/pituitary/hp/pituitary-treatment-pdq">Stage Information For Pituitary Tumors</SummaryRef> section.<Para id="_334">MRI is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of pituitary disorders because of  its multiplanar capability and good soft tissue contrast enhancement.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Sagittal T1-weighted images, clearly displaying the anterior and posterior lobes and the stalk on the same plane, and coronal images, displaying the relation between the pituitary and cavernous sinuses, are optimal for identifying a pituitary adenoma. A 3-mm thin slice typically is used to obtain optimal resolution.<Reference refidx="6"/>  CT may also be a useful diagnostic tool with coronal scans providing the optimal view;<Reference refidx="7"/>  however, CT may be less sensitive than MRI in this application.<Reference refidx="8"/>  For each imaging technique, a focal hypointensity within the pituitary gland is considered abnormal and suggestive of an adenoma.
