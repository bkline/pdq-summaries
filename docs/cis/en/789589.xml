It forms in the squamous cells of the respiratory tract or other places along the middle of the body.

There may be no symptoms in the early stages. Symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss may appear as the tumor grows. Depending on where the tumor forms in the body, other symptoms—such as a lump, pain, cough, or shortness of breath—may occur.</Para><Para id="_1735">These symptoms may be caused by problems other than childhood NUT carcinoma. The only way to know is to see your child's doctor.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1736"><Title>Tests to diagnose childhood NUT carcinoma</Title><Para id="_1737">If your child has symptoms that suggest a NUT carcinoma, their doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or another problem.

Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working. Other tests, such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460151" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">fluorescence in situ hybridization</GlossaryTermRef> (FISH), may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.</ListItem><ListItem>Molecular testing checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid. A molecular test may be done with other procedures, such as biopsies, to help diagnose some types of cancer.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
