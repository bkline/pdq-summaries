1 million people.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Although it mainly occurs in adults, children may be affected. The median age at
diagnosis is 46 years.  Historically, about 30%
of these malignancies are confined to the adrenal gland at diagnosis.<Reference refidx="2"/> However, more ACCs are being diagnosed at early stages, most likely because of the widespread use of high-quality imaging techniques.  
 </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_178"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_179">Retrospective studies have identified the following three important
prognostic factors:<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_180" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Completeness of resection. </ListItem><ListItem>Stage of disease. </ListItem><ListItem>Pathological grade. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_181">Patients who have low-grade tumors without evidence of invasion into local tissues or spread to lymph nodes have an improved prognosis. The role of other prognostic indicators is controversial. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_182"><Title>Clinical Features</Title><Para id="_183">In approximately 60% of patients, symptoms related to excessive hormone secretion are the main reason for seeking medical attention. Biochemical hormone testing reveals that up to 80% of tumors are functioning. The second most common symptoms at time of initial presentation are unspecific abdominal symptoms, such as abdominal pain or fullness. A small percentage of ACCs are incidentally discovered when imaging studies are conducted for reasons other than potential adrenal disease.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_184"><Title>Diagnosis</Title><Para id="_185">Initial evaluation should include careful endocrine studies to reveal any excessive hormone production by the tumor, which can serve as a tumor marker during therapy. Staging should include imaging of the primary site by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen. In addition, a CT of the chest is necessary to assess potential lung metastasis. Although the use of positron emission tomography may be effective in identifying unsuspected sites of metastases, its role as a staging tool is unclear. The detection of metastatic lesions may allow effective palliation of both functioning and nonfunctioning tumors. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_186"><Title>Prognosis and Survival</Title><Para id="_187">The most common sites of metastases are the lung, liver, peritoneum, and, less commonly, the bones and major veins. Palliation of metastatic functioning tumors may be achieved by resection of both the primary tumor and metastatic lesions. Unresectable or widely disseminated tumors may be palliated by adrenolytic therapy with mitotane, antihormonal drugs (i.e.,  ketoconazole and metyrapone), systemic chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. However, 5-year survival rates for patients with stage IV tumors are usually less than 20%.<Reference refidx="2"/> </Para><Para id="_188">Although several studies have shown partial or even complete remission, there is no convincing evidence that systemic therapy improves the survival duration of patients with adrenal cancer. Radical
open surgical excision is the treatment of choice for patients with localized malignancies and
remains the only method for achieving long-term disease-free survival.<Reference refidx="4"/> Overall 5-year survival rates are
approximately 38% to 46%.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="18973179">Bilimoria KY, Shen WT, Elaraj D, et al.: Adrenocortical carcinoma in the United States: treatment utilization and prognostic factors.
