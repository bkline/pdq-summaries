The growth and spread of cancer, as well as its treatment,
contribute to these conditions.</Para><Para id="_394">This summary reviews the definitions, causes, assessment, and treatment of each of these common gastrointestinal side effects. For information about treatment-related nausea and vomiting, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062747" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea/nausea-hp-pdq">Nausea and Vomiting Related to Cancer Treatment</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_3"><Strong><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062736#_8" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation/GI-complications-hp-pdq">Constipation </SummaryRef></Strong>is the slow movement of feces through the large intestine that
results in the passage of dry, hard stool.  This condition can result in discomfort or
pain.<Reference refidx="1"/>   The longer the transit time of stool in the large intestine, the
greater the fluid absorption and the drier and harder the stool becomes.</Para><Para id="_4">Constipation may be annoying and uncomfortable, but <Strong><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062736#_69" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation/GI-complications-hp-pdq">fecal impaction</SummaryRef></Strong> can be
life-threatening.  Impaction is the accumulation of dry, hardened feces
in the rectum or colon.  The patient with a fecal impaction may present with
circulatory, cardiac, or respiratory symptoms rather than with gastrointestinal 
symptoms.<Reference refidx="2"/>  If the fecal impaction is not recognized, the signs and symptoms
may progress and result in death.</Para><Para id="_5">In contrast to constipation and fecal impaction, a <Strong><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062736#_82" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation/GI-complications-hp-pdq">bowel obstruction</SummaryRef></Strong> is a
partial or complete occlusion of the bowel lumen by a process other than fecal
impaction.  Intestinal obstructions can be classified by the type of obstruction, the obstructing mechanism, and the part of the bowel involved.</Para><Para id="_147"><Strong><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062736#_119" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation/GI-complications-hp-pdq">Diarrhea</SummaryRef></Strong> can occur throughout cancer care, and the effects can be physically and emotionally devastating.  Although less prevalent than constipation, diarrhea remains a significant symptom burden for people with cancer.   Specific definitions of diarrhea vary widely.  Acute diarrhea is generally considered to be an abnormal increase in stool liquid and  the passage of  more than three unformed stools during a 24-hour period.<Reference refidx="3"/> Diarrhea is considered chronic when it persists longer than 4 weeks. This condition can have a significant impact on quality of life and, if severe, could be life-threatening.  Furthermore, diarrhea can lead to increased caregiver burden.</Para><Para id="_191"><Strong><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062736#_193" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation/GI-complications-hp-pdq">Radiation enteritis</SummaryRef></Strong> is a functional disorder of the large and small bowel that
occurs during or after a course of radiation therapy to the abdomen,
pelvis, or rectum.

can occur later as a side effect of a growing tumor or treatment of the tumor. 
For patients with cancer, other causative factors include the following:<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_395" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Medications (e.g., chemotherapy drugs, opioids, antacids, diuretics).</ListItem><ListItem>Diet (inadequate fluid intake, inadequate intake of dietary fiber, decreased appetite).</ListItem><ListItem>Prolonged immobility and/or inadequate exercise.</ListItem><ListItem>Bowel disorders (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis).</ListItem><ListItem>Neuromuscular disorders (disruption of innervation leading to atony of the bowel, spinal cord injury or compression).</ListItem><ListItem>Metabolic disorders (e.g., dehydration, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, uremia).</ListItem><ListItem>Depression.</ListItem><ListItem>Environmental factors (lack of privacy, change in bathroom habits, assistance to get to the bathroom).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_304">Any of these factors can occur because of the disease process, aging, debilitation,
or treatment.</Para><Para id="_396">Constipation is frequently the result of autonomic neuropathy caused by vinca alkaloids, oxaliplatin, taxanes, and thalidomide.  Other drugs, such as opioid
analgesics and anticholinergics (including antidepressants and antihistamines), may lead to
constipation by causing decreased sensitivity to the defecation reflex and
decreased gut motility.  Because constipation is common with the use of opioids,
a bowel regimen should be initiated when opioids are prescribed and
continued for as long as the patient takes them.  Opioids produce varying
degrees of constipation, suggesting a dose-related phenomenon. One study suggested that clinicians should not prescribe laxatives based on the opioid dose, but rather should titrate the laxative according to bowel function.  Lower doses of opioids or weaker opioids, such as codeine, are just as likely to cause constipation as higher doses and stronger opioids.<Reference refidx="3"/> For more information about opioid-induced constipation, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062738#_89" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-hp-pdq">Constipation</SummaryRef> section in Cancer Pain.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_39"><Title>Assessment of Constipation</Title><Para id="_40">A normal bowel pattern is having at least three stools per week and
no more than three stools per day; however, these criteria may be inappropriate for patients with cancer.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  </Para><Para id="_41">The following questions may provide a useful assessment guide:</Para><OrderedList id="_97" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>What is normal for the patient (frequency, amount, and timing)?</ListItem><ListItem>When was the last bowel movement?  What was the amount, consistency, and
color?  Was blood passed with it?</ListItem><ListItem>Has the patient been having any abdominal discomfort, cramping, nausea or
vomiting, pain, excessive gas, or rectal fullness?</ListItem><ListItem>Does the patient regularly use laxatives or enemas?  What does the patient
usually do to relieve constipation?  Does it usually work?</ListItem><ListItem>What type of diet does the patient follow?  How much and what type of fluids

medications, along with a physical examination, can identify possible causes of
constipation.  The evaluation also includes assessment of associated
symptoms such as distention, flatus, cramping, or rectal fullness. The following tests may be part of the clinical evaluation:<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_399" Style="bullet">

flatus, or abdominal distention.  Patients with colostomies are assessed for constipation.  Dietary habits, fluid intake, activity levels, and
use of opioids in these patients are examined.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_51"><Title>Management of Constipation</Title><Para id="_52">Comprehensive management of constipation includes prevention (if possible),
elimination of causative factors, and judicious use of laxatives.  Some
patients can be encouraged to increase dietary fiber (fruits; green, leafy
vegetables; 100% whole-grain cereals and breads; and bran) and to drink eight 8-oz. (240-mL) glasses of fluid daily unless contraindicated.

thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and/or mucositis from cancer and its treatment. 
In immunocompromised patients, manipulation of the rectum and anus should be avoided
(i.e., no rectal examinations, no suppositories, and no enemas).  These actions
can lead to the development of anal fissures or abscesses, which are portals of
entry for infection.  Also, the stoma of a patient with neutropenia should not be manipulated unnecessarily.</Para><Para id="_335">Transanal irrigation is a procedure in which water is introduced into the bowel through the anus.  A systematic review suggested that this procedure may be beneficial for patients with neurogenic bowel disease, low anterior resection syndrome, fecal incontinence, and chronic constipation.

the sacral nerves, the patient may experience back pain.  If the impaction
presses on the ureters, bladder, or urethra, urinary symptoms, such as urinary retention or  increased or decreased frequency or urgency of
urination, may develop.</Para><Para id="_74">When abdominal distention occurs, movement of the diaphragm may be compromised,
which can lead to insufficient aeration with subsequent hypoxia and/or left ventricular
dysfunction.  Hypoxia can, in turn, precipitate angina or tachycardia.  If the
vasovagal response is stimulated by the pressure of impaction, the patient may
become dizzy and hypotensive.
</Para><Para id="_75">Movement of stool around the impaction may result in diarrhea, which can be
explosive.  Coughing or activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure may
cause leakage of stool.  The leakage may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, and dehydration and is virtually diagnostic of the condition. 
The patient with an impaction may present in an acutely confused and
disoriented state, with signs of tachycardia, diaphoresis, fever, elevated or
low blood pressure, and/or abdominal fullness or rigidity.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_76"><Title>Assessment of Fecal Impaction</Title><Para id="_77">Assessment of fecal impaction includes the same questions as for the patient with
constipation. Additional
assessment includes auscultation of bowel sounds to determine if they are
present, absent, hyperactive, or hypoactive.  The abdomen is inspected
for distention and gently palpated for any masses, rigidity, or tenderness.  A
rectal examination will determine the presence of stool in the rectum or
sigmoid colon.  An abdominal x-ray (flat and upright) will show loss of haustral
markings, gas patterns reflecting gross amounts of stool, and dilatation
proximal to the impaction.<Reference refidx="2"/> For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062736#_39" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation/GI-complications-hp-pdq">Assessment of Constipation</SummaryRef> section.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_79"><Title>Treatment of Fecal Impaction</Title><Para id="_80">The primary treatment of impaction is to hydrate and soften the stool so that
it can be removed or passed.  Enemas  (oil retention, tap water, or
hypertonic phosphate) lubricate the bowel and soften the stool.  Caution must
be exercised in that fecal impaction can irritate the bowel wall, and excess enemas may perforate the bowel.  The patient may need to be digitally disimpacted if
the stool is within reach.  This is best done after administering an enema to
lubricate the bowel.

common during advanced stages of disease.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_88"><Title>Assessment and Diagnosis of Bowel Obstruction</Title><Para id="_89">Possible symptoms of malignant bowel obstruction include abdominal pain, cramps, distention, nausea, vomiting, absence of gas and stool passage, and, rarely, overflow diarrhea.<Reference refidx="3"/>    A complete
blood cell count, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis are obtained to evaluate
fluid and electrolyte imbalance and/or sepsis.  An elevated white blood cell

However, x-rays have only modest sensitivity to detect a bowel obstruction and limited ability to detect the exact site, cause, or complications. Contrast computed tomography (CT) delivers enhanced diagnostic precision. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast and/or a CT enterography may be used to diagnose patients suspected of having a small bowel obstruction.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_90"><Title>Treatment of Acute Bowel Obstruction</Title><Para id="_91">Careful serial examinations are necessary to manage patients with
progressive abdominal symptoms that may be due to acute bowel obstruction.  The
principles of supportive care in this setting include bowel rest, volume resuscitation,
correction of electrolyte imbalances, and transfusion support if necessary. 
These measures may precede or accompany decompression efforts.
</Para><Para id="_92">When bowel obstruction is partial, decompression of the distended bowel may be
attempted with nasogastric tubes (NGTs) or intestinal tubes.  The use of these tubes
may reduce edema, relieve fluid and gas accumulation, or
decrease the need for multiple stage procedures.<Reference refidx="6"/> However, surgery may be necessary
within 24 hours if there is complete, acute obstruction.
The use of self-expandable stents to decompress complete, acute malignant bowel obstruction has been noted to decrease the frequency of unnecessary surgery. The stents permit staging of the disease, increase the rate of primary anastomosis relative to colostomy, and decrease morbidity in patients with left-sided colon and rectal malignancies.  Further study is warranted, including cost analysis.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_93"><Title>Management of Chronic, Malignant Bowel Obstruction</Title><Para id="_94">Patients with advanced cancer may have chronic, progressive bowel obstruction

The ability to tolerate  solid food at hospital discharge was the criterion for successful palliation.   Multiple logistic regression analysis identified the absence of ascites and obstruction not involving the small bowel as predictors of successful surgical palliation in this population.  Successful palliation was achieved in 45% of patients and was maintained in 76% of this group at a median follow-up of 78 days, for an overall success rate of 35%.

         They may be placed under endoscopic guidance, with or without fluoroscopy, or by an interventional radiologist using fluoroscopy.   Morbidity with stent placement may be lower than with surgery.  Adequate imaging of the stricture itself and  the gastrointestinal tract distal to the stricture is recommended to assess stricture length, detect multifocal disease, and determine the appropriateness of stenting.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]<Reference refidx="22"/></Para><Para id="_95">When neither surgery nor stenting is possible, the accumulation 
of the unabsorbed secretions produce nausea, vomiting, pain, and colicky
activity as a result of the partial or complete occlusion of the lumen. 
In this case, temporary decompression may be accomplished using an NGT; however, NGTs are not favored as a long-term solution.<Reference refidx="3"/> Instead, a gastrostomy tube is commonly used to provide decompression of
 air and fluid that may accumulate and   cause  visceral distention and
pain.  The gastrostomy tube is placed into the stomach and is attached to a drainage bag
that can be easily concealed under clothing.  When the valve between the
gastrostomy tube and the bag is open, the patient may be able to eat or drink
by mouth without creating discomfort since the food is drained directly into
the bag.  Dietary discretion is advised to minimize the risk of tube
obstruction by solid food.  If the obstruction improves, the valve can be
closed, and the patient may once again benefit from enteral nutrition.
</Para><Para id="_96">Sometimes, decompression is difficult even with a gastrostomy tube in place. 
Accumulation of fluid may interfere with decompression because  several liters of
gastrointestinal secretions may be produced per day. Pharmacological symptom management may be necessary. In the case of complete obstruction, avoid oral administration of medications if possible.  To relieve continuous abdominal
pain, opioid analgesics may
be necessary. Associated nausea and vomiting may be treated with several different medications, including scopolamine, octreotide, dexamethasone, haloperidol, metoclopramide, dimenhydrinate, prochlorperazine, serotonin antagonists, and olanzapine.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Effective antispasmodics in this situation include
anticholinergics (such as scopolamine) <Reference refidx="23"/> and possibly
corticosteroids, as well as centrally acting agents.      </Para><Para id="_419">Careful use of laxatives may be considered for constipation associated with partial bowel obstruction. However, a 2022 systematic review did not identify any studies that examined laxatives in this setting.<Reference refidx="3"/> Osmotic laxatives, such as polyethylene glycol 3350, pull water into the lumen of the bowel, softening stool and increasing peristalsis. Bulk-forming laxatives such as psyllium should be avoided because they increase stool volume and can worsen the obstruction.  Finally, manual disimpaction may be necessary if fecal impaction is noted during physical examination.</Para><Para id="_393">Another option for management of refractory pain and/or nausea is the

More severe diarrhea/colitis may necessitate treatment with systemic steroids and even permanent discontinuation of ICI therapy.  Detailed management of ICI-induced diarrhea is further outlined in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the management of immunotherapy-related toxicities.<Reference refidx="77"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_364"><Title>Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors</Title><Para id="_365">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved four PI3K inhibitors, two of which (idelalisib and duvelisib) carry a boxed warning for gastrointestinal complications, including diarrhea.<Reference refidx="78"/><Reference refidx="79"/> Given the severity of diarrhea that may be seen with idelalisib, an expert panel convened to develop management strategies for idelalisib-associated diarrhea.<Reference refidx="80"/>  Panelists commented that it is not clear whether diarrhea is a class effect of PI3K inhibitors.  The authors noted that for idelalisib, two types of diarrhea may be seen. The first type appears to be self-limiting, occurring within the first 8 weeks of treatment. The second type tends to respond poorly to antidiarrheal therapy and occurs later,  approximately 7 months after the start of treatment.  In  the second type of diarrhea, the histological appearance of the colon is consistent with lymphocytic colitis. In this case, the panel recommended considering treatment with steroids or budesonide.<Reference refidx="80"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_TrialSearch_119_sid_5"><Title>Current Clinical Trials</Title><Para id="_TrialSearch_119_22">Use our <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced">advanced clinical trial search</ExternalRef> to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

Individuals with moderate or severe diarrhea were more likely to have a gastrostomy tube placement, weight loss, unplanned office visits, more inpatient days, and longer radiation therapy breaks.  This early report requires additional validation studies to fully evaluate the prevalence and impact of this phenomenon.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_428">Acute enteritis occurs during or within 3 months after irradiation, with the greatest prevalence during the fourth and fifth weeks.

epithelial layers to ulcers that may penetrate to different depths of the
intestinal wall, even to the serosa.  Lymphatic tissue is often atrophic or
absent.  The submucosa is severely diseased.  Arterioles and small arteries
