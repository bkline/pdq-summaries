Therefore, screening mammography has been advocated, even though it may begin at a relatively young age.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/></Para><SummarySection id="_878"><Title>Black women</Title></SummarySection><Para id="_879">Women who self-identify as Black in the United States have a lower overall lifetime risk of developing breast cancer than White women, although they have a slightly higher breast cancer incidence in their 30s and 40s. However, Black women have a 40% higher breast cancer mortality than White women, a finding that is attributed to multiple factors, such as delayed follow-up of abnormal mammograms, later stage at diagnosis, inferior breast cancer treatment, and more aggressive tumor types.</Para><Para id="_884">To inform the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2024 breast cancer screening recommendations, a modeling study was commissioned. This study used the six Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models to assess the benefits and harms of mammography screening at different starting ages and frequencies in the average-risk population of U.S. women, overall, and for Black women, specifically. The models incorporated race-specific data on breast cancer incidence, tumor subtypes, stage distribution, treatment quality/effectiveness, and mortality. Because of Black women’s inferior breast cancer outcomes, the models found that Black women experienced a slightly greater absolute benefit (i.e., more breast cancer deaths prevented) from mammography screening compared with the general population.<Reference refidx="29"/> For example, the models estimated that screening 1,000 women in the general population every 2 years between the ages of 50 years and 74 years (as recommended by previous USPSTF guidelines) would avert an estimated 6.7 breast cancer deaths, while biennial screening starting at age 40 years would avert an additional 1.3 breast cancer deaths. Among Black women, screening every 2 years between the ages of 50 years and 74 years would avert an estimated 9.2 breast cancer deaths per 1,000 women screened, while biennial screening starting at age 40 years would avert an additional 1.8 breast cancer deaths. (See <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_883" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>.)</Para><Para id="_885">In response to these findings and to address inequities in breast cancer outcomes, the USPSTF recommended that all average-risk women initiate screening at age 40 years (instead of at age 50 years, as previously recommended) and be screened every 2 years until age 74 years. Although this approach may result in additional lives saved, the models demonstrate that earlier screening also increases the likelihood of harm from mammography screening. In the general population of women, biennial screening from age 40 to 74 years, rather than age 50 to 74 years, would result in 503 additional false-positive results, 65 additional biopsies, and 2 additional overdiagnosed breast cancers per 1,000 women screened. Among Black women specifically, biennial screening starting at age 40 years, rather than at age 50 years, would result in 439 additional false-positive results, 75 additional biopsies, and 2 additional overdiagnosed breast cancers per 1,000 women screened. (See <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_883" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>.)</Para><Para id="_880">Although mathematical  modeling is increasingly used to estimate mammography’s benefits and harms, it has a number of limitations,  as described later in this summary. Limitations include models’ reliance on multiple assumptions and their inability to predict and incorporate factors that are as highly dynamic as breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. The assumptions and methods used by mathematical models are difficult for nonmodelers to understand. Therefore, it can be risky to base policy decisions on the findings of mathematical models.  Further, as the USPSTF has noted, to address higher breast cancer mortality in Black women, systematic approaches are needed to address existing inequities in screening quality, diagnostic processes, and treatment quality. It is not clear whether earlier screening initiation in the general population will improve outcomes among Black women without dedicated efforts to address such documented inequities.</Para><Table id="_883"><Title>Table 1.

First, SM may produce inferior quality images when compared with conventional DM, including poor visualization of microcalcifications.  Second, the eight radiologists had wide variations in experience (ranging from 0–19 years) reading screen film and/or DM and DBT in population-based breast cancer screening.</Para><Para id="_782">Another study used three different Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) breast cancer models and incorporated DBT screening performance data into the models to determine the cost and benefits of DBT versus DM. The study concluded that the use of DBT screening instead of DM reduced false-positives and recall rates and was projected to reduce breast cancer deaths (0–0.21 deaths per 1,000 women) and increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (1.97–3.27 per 1,000 women). However, these improvements were generally small and were associated with high costs relative to benefits: cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $195,026 to $270,135 per QALY gained. These are greater than commonly accepted thresholds of $50,000 to $150,000 per QALY.<Reference refidx="28"/></Para><Para id="_783">An important limitation of the available studies and statistical modeling is lack of evidence of the clinical significance of the additional breast cancers detected by DBT (with or without DM) versus DM alone. The extent to which DBT may contribute to overdiagnosis of non–life-threatening lesions or lesions that would have still been detected in an asymptomatic woman at the time of a future DM is unknown. To date, there are no studies of DBT that show a reduction in metastatic disease or other late-stage disease.</Para><Para id="_804">Five ongoing randomized controlled trials with a combined recruitment of 430,000 women in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States are expected to provide information about clinical breast cancer outcomes  of mammographic screening using DBT compared with DM.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_839">The randomized TOSYMA trial assessed DBT plus synthesized mammography versus digital screening mammography alone for the detection of breast cancer. The primary end points were detection of invasive breast cancer and the interval invasive cancer detection rate at 24 months.  However, neither of these end points has been validated as proper surrogate outcome measures for mortality.  The detection of greater numbers of early-stage cancers may confer no mortality benefit, as many of these cancers may fail to progress or progress so slowly that they pose no threat to the patient’s life (i.e., result in overdiagnosis).  Moreover, if the detection of nonlethal cancers substantially increases, then the interval cancer detection rates may decrease with no subsequent reduction in mortality.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_840">A cohort study comparing DBT with DM found that the two modalities were not associated with a significant difference in risk of interval invasive cancer. However, DBT was associated with a significantly lower risk of advanced breast cancer among women with extremely dense breasts at high risk of developing breast cancer.<Reference refidx="30"/>

Better clarification on this issue may come from the ongoing Tomosynthesis Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (TMIST), in which women are randomly assigned to either standard digital breast imaging or DBT, and the primary outcome is rate of advanced cancers, a composite end point that includes distant metastases.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_72"><Title>Characteristics of Cancers Detected by Breast Imaging </Title><Para id="_112">Regardless of stage, nodal status, and tumor size, screen-detected cancers have a better prognosis than those diagnosed outside of screening.<Reference refidx="2"/> This suggests that they are biologically less lethal (perhaps slower growing and less likely to invade locally and metastasize). This is consistent with the length bias effect associated with screening.  That is, screening is more likely to detect indolent (i.e., slow-growing) breast cancers, while the more aggressive cancers are detected in the intervals between screening sessions.</Para><Para id="_114">A 10-year follow-up study of 1,983 Finnish women with invasive breast cancer demonstrated that the method of cancer detection is an independent prognostic variable. When controlled for age, nodal status, and tumor size, screen-detected cancers had a lower risk of relapse and better overall survival. For women whose cancers were detected outside of screening, the hazard ratio (HR) for death was 1.90 (95% CI, 1.15–3.11), even though they were more likely to receive adjuvant systemic therapy.<Reference refidx="31"/></Para><Para id="_115">Similarly, an examination of the breast cancers found in three randomized screening trials (Health Insurance Plan, National Breast Screening Study [NBSS]-1, and NBSS-2) accounted for stage, nodal status, and tumor size and determined that patients whose cancer was found via screening had a more favorable prognosis.

The HR for survival of the symptomatic women was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.63–0.99).<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="33"/></Para><Para id="_707">The findings of these studies are also consistent with the evidence that some screen-detected cancers are low risk and represent overdiagnosis.</Para><SummarySection id="_49"><Title>Screening biases–concepts</Title><Para id="_77">Numerous uncontrolled trials and retrospective series have documented the ability of mammography to diagnose small, early-stage breast cancers, which have a favorable clinical course.<Reference refidx="34"/>  Individuals whose cancer is detected by screening show a higher survival rate than those whose cancers are not detected by screening even when screening has not prolonged any lives. This concept is explained by the following four types of statistical bias:</Para><OrderedList id="_78" Style="Arabic">
     <ListItem><Strong>Lead-time bias</Strong>: Cancer detected by screening earlier than the cancer would have been detected based on symptoms does nothing but advance the date of diagnosis. Earlier detection and treatment do not alter the natural disease progression. The 5-year survival rate from the time of diagnosis is longer for a cancer caught early even when the screening has made no difference in how long the person lives.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Length bias</Strong>: Screening mammography detects slowly growing cancers that have a better prognosis than cancers presenting clinically (detected by the doctor or the person when he or she gets ill).

Therefore, their outcomes will be better than those of women who are neither healthy nor health-conscious, regardless of possible benefits of early diagnosis. One study  identified that women who accept invitations to screening are more health-conscious, have better access to health care, and have lower mortality from causes other than breast cancer.<Reference refidx="35"/></ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_79">The impact of these biases is not known. A new randomized controlled trial (RCT) with cause-specific mortality as the end point is needed to determine both survival benefit and impact of overdiagnosis, lead time, length time, and healthy volunteer biases. This is not achievable; randomly assigning patients to screen and nonscreen groups would be unethical, and at least three decades of follow-up would be needed, during which time changes in treatment and imaging technology would invalidate the results.  Decisions must therefore be based on available RCTs, despite their limitations, and on ecological or cohort studies with adequate control groups and adjustment for confounding.

There was great variation in results among the studies, with four studies finding a relative reduction in breast cancer mortality of 33% or more (with wide CIs) and five studies finding no reduction in breast cancer mortality.

Over the study, the absolute increase in the incidence of early-stage cancer was 122 cancers per 100,000 women, while the absolute decrease in late-stage cancers was 8 cases per 100,000 women.  After adjusting for changes in incidence resulting from hormone therapy and other undefined causes, the authors concluded (1) the benefit of screening  on breast cancer mortality  was small, (2) between 22% and 31% of diagnosed breast cancers represented overdiagnosis, and (3) the observed improvement in breast cancer mortality was probably attributable to improved treatment rather than screening.<Reference refidx="104"/> </Para><Para id="_622">An analytic approach was used to approximate the contributions of screening versus treatment to breast cancer mortality reduction and the magnitude of overdiagnosis.<Reference refidx="105"/>  The shift in the size distribution of breast cancers in the United States  (before the introduction of mammography) to 2012  (after its widespread dissemination), was investigated using SEER data in women aged 40 years and older.

The authors documented a lower incidence of larger (≥2 cm) tumors as well as a reduction in breast cancer case fatality.

It is a special concern because identification of the cancer does not benefit the individual, while the side effects of diagnostic procedures and cancer treatment may cause significant harm. The magnitude of overdiagnosis is debated, particularly regarding DCIS, a cancer precursor whose natural history is unknown. By reason of this inability to predict confidently the tumor behavior at time of diagnosis, standard treatment for invasive cancers and DCIS can cause overtreatment. The related harms include treatment-related side effects and the number of harms associated with a cancer diagnosis, which are immediate. Conversely, a mortality benefit would occur at an uncertain point in the future.</Para><Para id="_685">One approach to understanding overdiagnosis is to examine the prevalence of occult cancer in women who died of noncancer causes. In an overview of seven autopsy studies, the median prevalence of occult invasive breast cancer was 1.3% (range, 0%–1.8%) and of DCIS was 8.9% (range, 0%–14.7%).<Reference refidx="118"/><Reference refidx="119"/></Para><Para id="_686">Overdiagnosis can be indirectly measured by comparing breast cancer incidence in screened versus unscreened populations. These comparisons can be confounded by differences in the populations, such as time, geography, health behaviors, and hormone usage. The calculations of overdiagnosis can vary in their adjustment for lead-time bias.<Reference refidx="120"/><Reference refidx="121"/> An overview of 29 studies found calculated rates of overdiagnosis to be 0%–54%, with rates from randomized studies between 11% and 22%.<Reference refidx="122"/> In Denmark, where screened and unscreened populations existed concurrently, the rate of overdiagnosis of invasive cancer was calculated to be 14% and 39%, using two different methodologies. If DCIS cases were included, the overdiagnosis rates were 24% and 48%.  The second methodology accounts for regional differences in women younger than the screening age and is likely more accurate.<Reference refidx="123"/></Para><Para id="_687">Theoretically, in a given population, the detection of more breast cancers at an early stage would result in a subsequent reduction in the incidence of advanced-stage cancers.  This has not occurred in any of the populations studied to date.  Thus, the detection of more early-stage cancers likely represents overdiagnosis. A population-based study in the Netherlands showed that about one-half of all screen-detected breast cancers, including DCIS, would represent overdiagnosis and is consistent with other studies, which showed substantial rates of overdiagnosis associated with screening.<Reference refidx="124"/></Para><Para id="_688">A cohort study in Norway compared the increase in cancer incidence in women who were eligible for screening with the cancer incidence in younger women who were not eligible for screening, eligibility was based on age and residence. Eligible women experienced a 60% increase in incidence of localized cancers (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.42–1.79), while the incidence of advanced cancers remained similar in the two groups (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.86–1.35).<Reference refidx="125"/></Para><Para id="_689">A population study that compared different counties in the United States showed that higher rates of screening mammography use were associated with higher rates of breast cancer diagnoses, yet there was no corresponding decrease in 10-year breast cancer mortality.<Reference refidx="126"/> The strengths of this study include its very large size (16 million women) and the strength and consistency of correlation observed across counties. The limitations of this study include the self-reporting of mammograms, the use of a 2-year window to estimate screening prevalence, and the period of analysis (when menopausal hormone use was present).<Reference refidx="126"/></Para><Para id="_690">The extent of overdiagnosis has been estimated in the Canadian NBSS, a randomized clinical trial. At the end of the five screening rounds, 142 more invasive breast cancer cases were diagnosed in the mammography arm, compared with the control arm.<Reference refidx="127"/> At 15 years, the excess number of cancer cases in the mammography arm versus the control arm was 106, representing an overdiagnosis rate of 22% for the 484 screen-detected invasive cancers.<Reference refidx="127"/></Para><Para id="_713">As a consequence of screening mammography, greater numbers of breast cancers with indolent behavior are now identified, resulting in potential overtreatment. In a secondary analysis of a randomized trial of tamoxifen versus no systemic therapy in patients with early breast cancer, the authors utilized the 70-gene MammaPrint assay and identified 15% of patients at ultra-low risk, with 20-year disease-specific survival rates of 97% in the tamoxifen group and 94% in the control group. Thus, these patients would likely have extremely good outcomes with surgery alone. The frequency of such ultra-low risk cancers in the screened population is likely around 25%. Tools such as the 70-gene MammaPrint assay might be utilized in the future to identify these cancers, and thereby, reduce the risk of overtreatment. However, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.<Reference refidx="128"/></Para><Para id="_739">In 2016,  the Canadian NBSS, a randomized screening trial with 25-year follow-up, re-estimated overdiagnosis of breast cancer from mammography screening by age group and concluded that approximately 30% of invasive screen-detected cancers in women aged 40 to 49 years and up to 20% of those detected in women aged 50 to 59 years were overdiagnosed. When <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> cancers are included, the estimated risks of overdiagnosis are 40% aged 40 to 49 years and 30% in women aged 50 to 59 years. Overdiagnosis was calculated as the persistent excess incidence in the screened arm versus the control arm  divided by the number of screen-detected cases (excess incidence method).
 
Requirements  for adequate estimation of overdiagnosis utilizing this method included the following:</Para><OrderedList id="_732" Style="Arabic">
     <ListItem>Cessation of screening among participants in the screened arm when the trial screening protocol is completed.</ListItem><ListItem>Follow-up after screening ceases needs to be as long as the longest lead time (the  time between the identification of a screen-detected cancer until symptomatic diagnosis of that cancer in the absence of screening) among the screen-detected cases.</ListItem><ListItem>The comparison population for the cancer incidence during screening and after screening cessation in the screened arm needs to comprise individuals with comparable cancer risk in the absence of screening, as in a randomized control arm.</ListItem><ListItem>Compliance with screening is high in the screened arm during the trial protocol screening phase, and contamination (nonprotocol screening) in the control arm is low.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_740">These conditions were largely met in the CNBSS because  population-based screening did not become available throughout Canada until a minimum of 2  years later and in most instances 5 to 10 years later (thereby, allowing for cessation of screening after the trial screening period and follow-up longer than most estimates of lead time), because contamination is documented to have been minimal, and because individual randomization resulted in 44 almost identically distributed demographic factors and risk factors between the two trial arms.</Para><Para id="_741"> Since the conclusion of the trial  screening period in 1988, differences in screening quality, intensity, invited age range, and biopsy thresholds decrease the generalizability of these results. These factors and improved imaging technique/quality and low threshold for biopsy, likely contribute to lower  estimates of overdiagnosis of <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> cancer than that of invasive cancer.<Reference refidx="129"/></Para><Para id="_691"><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_483" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Table 2</SummaryRef> shows results from a 10-year period of screening 10,000 women, estimating the number of women with breast cancer or DCIS that would never become clinically important (overdiagnosis). There was likely no overdiagnosis in the Health Insurance Plan study, which used old-technology mammography and CBE. Overdiagnosis has become more prominent in the era of improved-technology mammography. The improved technology has not, however, been shown to make further reductions in mortality than the original technology. In summary,  breast cancer overdiagnosis is a complex topic. Studies that used many different methods reported a wide range of estimates,  and there is currently no way to assess whether new cancer cases are overdiagnosed or are of real harm to patients.<Reference refidx="110"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_406"><Title>False-positives leading to additional interventions</Title><Para id="_407">Because fewer than 5 per 1,000 women  screened have breast cancer, most abnormal mammograms are false-positives, even given the 90% specificity of mammography (i.e., 90% of all women without breast cancer will have a negative mammogram).<Reference refidx="85"/></Para><Para id="_698">This high false-positive rate of mammography is underestimated and can seem counterintuitive because of a statistically based cognitive bias known as the base rate fallacy. Because the base rate of breast cancer is low, (5/1000), the false-positive rate vastly exceeds the true-positive rate, even when using a very accurate test.</Para><Para id="_699">Mammography’s true-positive rate of approximately 90% means that, of women with breast cancer, approximately 90% will test positive. The true-negative rate of 90% means that, of women without breast cancer, 90% will test negative.  A 10% false-positive rate over 1,000 people means that there will be 100 false-positives in 1,000 people. If 5 in 1,000 women have breast cancer, then 4.5 women with breast cancer will have a positive test. In other words, there will approximately 100 false-positives for every 4.5 true positives.</Para><Para id="_700">Further, abnormal results from screening mammograms prompt additional tests and procedures, such as mammographic views of the region of concern, ultrasound, MRI, and  tissue sampling (by fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, or excisional biopsy). Overall, the harm from unnecessary tests and treatments must be weighed against the benefit of early detection.</Para><Para id="_408">A study of breast cancer screening in 2,400 women enrolled in a health maintenance organization found that over a decade, 88 cancers were diagnosed, 58 of which were identified by mammography. One-third of the women had an abnormal mammogram result that required additional testing: 539 additional mammograms, 186 ultrasound examinations, and 188 biopsies. The cumulative biopsy rate (the rate of true positives) resulting from mammographic findings was approximately 1 in 4 (23.6%). The PPV of an abnormal screening mammogram in this population was 6.3% for women aged 40 to 49 years, 6.6% for women aged 50 to 59 years, and 7.8% for women aged 60 to 69 years.<Reference refidx="130"/> A subsequent analysis and modeling of data from the same cohort of women, estimated that the risk of having at least one false-positive mammogram was 7.4% (95% CI, 6.4%–8.5%) at the first mammogram, 26.0% (95% CI, 24.0%–28.2%) by the fifth mammogram, and 43.1% (95% CI, 36.6%–53.6%) by the ninth mammogram.<Reference refidx="131"/> Cumulative risk of at least one false-positive result  depended on four patient variables (younger age, higher number of previous breast biopsies, family history of breast cancer, and current estrogen use) and three radiologic variables (longer time between screenings, failure to compare the current and previous mammograms, and the individual radiologist’s tendency to interpret mammograms as abnormal). Overall, the factor most responsible for a false-positive mammogram was the individual radiologist’s tendency to read mammograms as abnormal.

</Para><Para id="_453">A prospective cohort study of community-based screening found that a greater proportion of women undergoing annual screening had at least one false-positive screen after 10 years than did women undergoing biennial screening, regardless of breast density.  For women with scattered fibroglandular densities, the difference was 68.9% (annual) versus 46.3% (biennial) for women in their 40s.

Many of these missed cancers are high risk, with adverse biological characteristics.

The Canadian National Breast Screening Study (CNBSS) compared high-quality CBE plus mammography with CBE alone in women aged 50 to 59 years.  CBE, lasting 5 to 10 minutes per breast, was conducted by trained health professionals, with periodic evaluations of performance quality. The frequency of cancer diagnosis, stage, interval cancers, and breast cancer mortality were similar in the two groups and similar to outcomes with mammography alone.<Reference refidx="1"/> With a mean follow-up of 13 years, breast cancer mortality was similar in the two groups (mortality rate ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78–1.33).<Reference refidx="2"/> The investigators estimated the operating characteristics for CBE alone;  for 19,965 women aged 50 to 59 years, sensitivity was 83%, 71%, 57%, 83%, and 77% for years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the trial, respectively; specificity ranged between 88% and 96%. Positive predictive value (PPV), which is the proportion of cancers detected per abnormal examination, was estimated to be 3% to 4%. For 25,620 women aged 40 to 49 years who were examined only at entry, the estimated sensitivity was 71%, specificity was 84%, and PPV was 1.5%.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_189">In clinical trials involving community clinicians, CBE-type screening had higher specificity (97%–99%) <Reference refidx="4"/> and lower sensitivity (22%–36%) than that experienced by examiners.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> A study of screening in women with a positive family history of breast cancer showed that, after a normal initial evaluation, the patient herself, or her clinician performing a CBE, identified more cancers than did mammography.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_708"> Another study examined the usefulness of adding CBE to screening mammography;  among 61,688 women older than 40 years and screened by mammography and CBE, sensitivity for mammography was 78%, and combined mammography-CBE sensitivity was  82%. Specificity was lower for women undergoing both screening modalities than it was for women undergoing mammography alone (97% vs. 99%).<Reference refidx="10"/>   Another study reported the results of a large cluster randomized controlled trial in  India that assessed the efficacy of  screening with CBE versus no screening on breast cancer mortality.<Reference refidx="11"/>  This trial recruited 151,538 women aged 35 to 64 years with no history of breast cancer.   After 20 years of follow-up, there was an overall statistically nonsignificant 15% reduction in breast cancer mortality in the screening with CBE arm versus the control arm, but a post hoc subset analysis demonstrated a statistically significant 30% relative reduction in mortality attributable to screening with CBE for women older than 50 years.  However, the results of the subset analysis should be interpreted with caution, as this was a cluster randomized trial with only 20 clusters, which raises concerns about potential imbalances between the control and study arms of the trial.     Other international trials of CBE are under way, one  in India and  one in Egypt.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_190"><Title>Breast Self-Examination (BSE)</Title><Para id="_191">Monthly BSE has been promoted, but there is no evidence that it reduces breast cancer mortality.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/> The only large,  randomized clinical trial of BSE assigned 266,064 female Shanghai factory workers to either  BSE instruction with reinforcement and encouragement, or instruction on the prevention of lower back pain.

After 10 years of follow-up, breast cancer mortality rates were similar to the rates in centers without organized BSE education (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.93–1.22).<Reference refidx="16"/>  Thirdly, in contrast, a case-control study nested within the CNBSS compared self-reported BSE frequency before enrollment with breast cancer mortality.

<Strong>Cause of death attribution:</Strong>   Women who died of breast cancer that had been diagnosed before entry into the study were excluded from the comparison between the screening and control groups. However, these exclusions were determined differently within the two groups. Women in the screening 
group were excluded based on determinations made during the study 
period at their initial screening visits. These women were dropped 
from all further consideration in the study. By design, controls did 
not have regular clinic visits, so the prestudy cancer status of 
control patients was not determined. When a control patient died and 
her cause of death was determined to be breast cancer, a 
retrospective examination was made to determine the date of diagnosis 
of her disease. If the date preceded the study period, the control patient was 
excluded from the analysis. This difference in methodology has the 
potential for a substantial bias when comparing breast cancer mortality 
between the two groups, and this bias is likely to favor screening.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Analysis:</Strong> Follow-up.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>External audit:</Strong> No.

</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Comments:</Strong> The MMGs were of poor quality compared with  those of later
trials, because of outdated equipment and techniques.  The intervention consisted of both MMG and CBE.  Major concerns about trial
performance are the validity of the initial randomization and the differential
exclusion of women with a prior history of breast cancer.

 This is the only trial specifically designed to study women aged 40
to 49 years.  Cancers diagnosed at entry in both study and control groups were
included.  Concerns were expressed before the completion of the trial about
the technical adequacy of the MMGs, the training of the radiologists, and the
standardization of the equipment, which prompted an independent external
review.  The primary deficiency identified by this review was the use of the
mediolateral view from 1980 to 1985 instead of the mediolateral oblique view,
which was used after 1985.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Subsequent analyses found the size and stage
of the cancers detected mammographically in this trial to be equivalent to
those of other trials.<Reference refidx="14"/>  This trial and NBSS-2 differ from the other randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in
the consistent use of adjuvant hormone therapy and chemotherapy following local breast
cancer therapy in women with axillary node-positive disease.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_389"><Strong>NBSS-2, Canada 1980 </Strong><Reference refidx="15"/>

The absolute difference in breast cancer mortality was -0.6 deaths per 1,667 women in the 40 to 49 years age group; 1,150 women would need to be screened to prevent one breast cancer death in this age group.  A post hoc analysis showed that years of life lost caused by breast cancer mortality were 67.4 out of 1,000 women in the intervention group versus 78.9 out of 1,000 women in the control group; this is equivalent to 11.5 years of life saved per 1,000 women invited to screening in the intervention group and a total of 620 years of life saved.</ListItem><ListItem>There was no statistically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality or all-cause mortality in the intervention group compared with the control group.</ListItem><ListItem>In the intervention group, 18.1% of women had at least one false-positive result.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_823">This evidence is inadequate to support the conclusion of a clinically significant breast cancer mortality reduction attributable to initiation of screening mammography among women aged 39 to 49 years. The reported mortality reduction is a small, transient reduction in breast cancer mortality based on post hoc, subset analysis, nonstandard imaging protocol, and nonstandard threshold for biopsy (microcalcifications were not biopsied). In absolute terms, the difference in breast cancer mortality was -0.6 deaths per 1,667 women in the 40 to 49 years age group based on a reanalysis of the original data set, which was not statistically significant, and the recalculation of breast cancer mortality in a subgroup restricted to 10 years of follow-up. At a  median follow-up of 22.9 years, there was no statistically significant decrease in risk of breast cancer or all-cause mortality.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_824">This evidence is inadequate to make a clear determination of the magnitude of overdiagnosis. Because the evidence is based on subgroup analysis and nonstandard imaging schedule, nonstandard imaging protocol, and a nonstandard threshold for biopsy (microcalcifications were not biopsied) with uncertain relevance to the general population, it does not support the investigators' conclusion of “at worst a small amount of overdiagnosis."<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="6955542" MedlineID="82269994">Shapiro S, Venet W, Strax P, et al.: Ten- to fourteen-year effect of screening on breast cancer mortality.
