The true incidence of bile duct cancer is unknown because   establishing an accurate diagnosis is difficult.</Para><Para id="_226">Traditionally, bile duct tumors located within the liver were classified with hepatocellular carcinoma as primary liver tumors.<Reference refidx="1"/>  In contrast, bile duct tumors located outside of the liver were classified with gallbladder cancer as extrahepatic biliary tract tumors.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The classification of bile duct tumors has changed to include intrahepatic tumors of the bile ducts and extrahepatic tumors (perihilar and distal) of the bile ducts.</Para><Para id="_341">Approximately 50% of cholangiocarcinomas arise in the bile ducts of the perihilar region, 40% in the distal region, and 10% in the intrahepatic region.</Para><Para id="_3">Many bile duct cancers are multifocal. In most patients, the tumor cannot be completely removed by surgery and is incurable. Palliative  measures such as resection, radiation therapy (e.g., brachytherapy or external-beam radiation therapy), or stenting procedures may maintain adequate biliary drainage and allow for improved quality of life. </Para><SummarySection id="_4"><Title>Anatomy</Title><Para id="_84">The biliary system consists of a network of ducts that carry bile from the liver to the small bowel and is classified by its anatomical location (Figure <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062905#_253" url="/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq">1</SummaryRef>).

Because of proximity to major blood vessels and diffuse extension within the liver, a bile duct tumor can be difficult to resect.

uncommon, but intra-abdominal metastases, particularly peritoneal metastases, do occur. Transperitoneal and hematogenous hepatic metastases also occur
