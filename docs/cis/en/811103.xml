The bladder has a muscular wall that allows it to get larger to store urine made by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046325" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">kidneys</GlossaryTermRef>, and to shrink to squeeze urine out of the body. There are two kidneys, one on each side of the backbone, above the waist.

The most common symptom of bladder cancer is blood in the urine, called hematuria. It’s often slightly rusty to bright red in color. You may see blood in your child’s urine at one point, then not see it again for a while. Sometimes there are very small amounts of blood in the urine that can only be found by having a test done.</Para><Para id="_13">Other common symptoms of bladder cancer can include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_14" Style="bullet">

Keep in mind that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000800915" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">urinary tract infections</GlossaryTermRef>, kidney or bladder stones, or other problems related to the kidney could also be the cause, not cancer. Your child’s doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them. They’ll most likely ask for a urine sample as a first step in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">diagnosing</GlossaryTermRef> what is causing these symptoms.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_16"><SectMetaData><SectionType>Diagnostic tests</SectionType></SectMetaData><Title>Tests to diagnose childhood bladder cancer</Title><Para id="_17">If your child has symptoms or lab test results that suggest bladder cancer, their doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or another problem.
