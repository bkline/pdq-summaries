pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents

these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity

trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
