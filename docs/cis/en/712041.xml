The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Central Nervous System Tumours implements some molecular parameters, in addition to histology, to define brain tumor entities.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> Some CNS tumor types, such as embryonal tumors and gliomas, are organized according to molecular characterization. However, this updated classification schema does not yet categorize intracranial GCTs using molecular parameters. Tumor location, extent of disease (brain invasion and tumor spread), and type of CNS GCT histology remain important factors that affect treatment and prognosis.</Para><Para id="_1807">CNS GCTs are broadly classified as germinomatous (commonly referred to as germinoma) and nongerminomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs) on the basis of clinicopathological and laboratory features, including tumor markers.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> An alternative therapeutic classification in Japan distinguishes three groups on the basis of their prognosis: good prognosis (e.g., germinoma), intermediate prognosis (e.g., immature teratoma with malignant transformation), and poor prognosis (e.g., yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma, and mixed tumors of those entities).<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_1803">The PDQ childhood brain tumor treatment summaries are organized primarily according to the  WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumours.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> For a full description of the classification of CNS tumors and a link to the corresponding treatment summary for each type of brain tumor, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062680" url="/types/brain/hp/child-brain-treatment-pdq">Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Summary Index</SummaryRef>.</Para><SummarySection id="_118"><Title>Incidence</Title><Para id="_119">In Western countries,  GCTs represent 3% to  4% of primary brain tumors in children, with a peak incidence from age 10 to 19 years.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> In Japan and other Asian countries, a series reported the incidence of CNS GCTs to be approximately 15% of all pediatric CNS tumors.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> The genetic or environmental reasons for these differences remain unknown.</Para><Para id="_1868"> Overall, males have a higher incidence of GCTs than females.

The most common site of origin is the pineal region (45%), and the second most common site is the suprasellar region (30%) within the infundibulum or pituitary stalk. Both of these sites are considered extra-axial or nonparenchymal CNS locations. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients present with synchronous tumors arising in both the suprasellar and pineal locations.

Diabetes insipidus caused by antidiuretic hormone deficiency occurs in 70% to 90% of patients and is the most common sentinel symptom. Patients can usually compensate for this deficiency by drinking excessive amounts of fluid for months to years. Eventually, other hormonal symptoms and visual deficits may emerge as the tumor expands dorsally and compresses or invades the optic chiasm and/or fills the third ventricle to cause hydrocephalus.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/> </ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Pineal region.</Strong> Patients with tumors in the pineal region usually have a shorter history of symptoms than patients with tumors of the suprasellar or basal ganglionic region, with weeks to months of symptoms that include raised intracranial pressure and diplopia related to tectal and aqueductal compression. Signs and symptoms unique to masses in the pineal and posterior third ventricular region include Parinaud syndrome (vertical gaze impairment, convergence nystagmus, and light-near pupillary response dissociation), headache, and nausea and vomiting.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Bifocal tumors. </Strong>Patients with bifocal primary tumors present with metasynchronous lesions in the suprasellar and pineal regions.<Reference refidx="15"/> The secondary lesion is often asymptomatic and found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

If preoperative CSF can be obtained safely and tumor markers are found to be elevated, histological confirmation may not be needed. Before definitive therapy is initiated, a lumbar CSF assessment for cytology and tumor markers should be performed, if safe, to reconfirm the diagnosis and help monitor treatment response and control. The diagnostic utility of lumbar CSF is better validated and more reliable than that obtained from the ventricles (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000712041#_1810" url="/types/brain/hp/child-cns-germ-cell-treatment-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>).<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/></ListItem><ListItem>Evaluation of pituitary/hypothalamic function.</ListItem><ListItem>Visual-field and acuity examinations for suprasellar or hypothalamic tumors.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_120">If possible, a baseline neuropsychological examination should be performed after symptoms of endocrine deficiency and raised intracranial pressure are resolved.</Para><Para id="_63">CNS GCTs can be diagnosed and classified on the basis of histology alone, tumor markers alone, or a combination of both.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/> A diagnosis of GCTs often requires a tumor biopsy, except when imaging characteristics are present and increased tumor markers (usually AFP and beta-HCG) are found in the serum and/or CSF. The tumor markers AFP and beta-HCG are the most useful, although other markers, such as  placental alkaline phosphatase  and c-kit, are being investigated (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000712041#_1810" url="/types/brain/hp/child-cns-germ-cell-treatment-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>). When the tumor markers are negative or mildly elevated but below diagnostic criteria, or if there are any atypical findings, an endoscopic or open biopsy is needed to make a definitive diagnosis.</Para><Para id="_11">  Distinguishing between different GCT types by CSF protein marker levels alone is somewhat arbitrary, and standards vary across continents. Patients with pure germinomas and teratomas usually present with negative markers, but low levels of beta-HCG can be detected in patients with germinomas.<Reference refidx="22"/> Current international efforts are directed at determining a marker threshold for beta-HCG–secreting germinomas because data suggest that the beta-HCG levels that are used to distinguish germinomas from NGGCTs (50 IU/L in Europe and 100 IU/L in North America) are questionable.</Para><Para id="_123">The use of tumor markers and histology in GCT clinical trials is evolving.
