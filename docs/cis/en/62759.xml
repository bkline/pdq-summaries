The uterine cervix is a cylindrical, fibrous organ that is an average of 3 to 4 cm in length.  The portio of the cervix is visible on vaginal inspection.  The opening of the cervix is termed the external os.  The os is the beginning of the endocervical canal, which forms the inner aspect of the cervix.  At the upper aspect of the endocervical canal is the internal os, a narrowing of the endocervical canal.  The narrowing marks the transition from the cervix to the uterine body.  The endocervical canal beyond the internal os is termed the endometrial canal.</Para><Para id="_669">The cervix is lined by two types of epithelial cells: squamous cells at the outer aspect and columnar, glandular cells along the inner canal.   The transition between squamous cells and columnar cells is an area termed the squamocolumnar junction.  Most precancerous and cancerous changes arise in this zone. </Para><MediaLink ref="CDR0000609921" type="image/jpeg" alt="Anatomy of the female reproductive system; drawing shows the uterus, myometrium (muscular outer layer of the uterus), endometrium (inner lining of the uterus), ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina." language="en" placement="image-center-medium" id="_395"/></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_532"><Title>Pathogenesis</Title><Para id="_533">Cervical carcinoma begins at the squamocolumnar junction. It can involve the outer squamous cells, inner glandular cells, or both.  The precursor lesion is
dysplasia: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or adenocarcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>,
which can subsequently become invasive cancer.  This process can be quite slow. 
Longitudinal studies have shown that in patients with untreated <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>
cervical cancer, 30% to 70% will develop invasive carcinoma over a period of 10
to 12 years.  However, in about 10% of patients, lesions can progress from <Emphasis>in
situ</Emphasis> to invasive in less than  1 year.  As it becomes invasive, the
tumor breaks through the basement membrane and invades the cervical stroma. 
Extension of the tumor in the cervix may ultimately manifest as ulceration,
exophytic tumor, or extensive infiltration of underlying tissue, including
the bladder or rectum.

Epidemiological studies convincingly demonstrate that the major risk factor for development of preinvasive or invasive carcinoma of the cervix is HPV infection, far outweighing other known risk factors.</Para><Para id="_535">More than 6 million
women in the United States are estimated to be infected with  HPV. Transient HPV infection is common, particularly in young women,<Reference refidx="16"/> while cervical cancer is rare.  The persistence of an HPV infection leads to increased risk of developing  precancerous and cancerous lesions.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_537">The strain of HPV infection is also important in conferring risk.  Multiple subtypes of HPV infect humans; subtypes 16 and 18 have been most closely associated with high-grade dysplasia and cancer.  Studies  suggest that acute infection with HPV types 16 and
18 conferred an 11-fold to 16.9-fold risk of rapid development of high-grade CIN.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/> Further studies have shown that infection with either HPV 16 or 18 is more predictive than cytological screening of high-grade CIN or greater disease, and that the predictive ability is seen for up to 18 years after the initial test.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_671">There are two commercially available vaccines that target anogenital-related strains of HPV.

A study of 642 women found that 83% had one  or more tumorigenic HPV types
when cervical cytological specimens were assayed by a sensitive (hybrid capture)
technique.<Reference refidx="26"/>  The authors of the study and an accompanying editorial
concluded that using HPV DNA testing in this setting does not add sufficient
information to justify its cost.<Reference refidx="26"/>  </Para><Para id="_620">  HPV DNA testing has proven
useful in triaging patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance to colposcopy and has been integrated into current screening guidelines.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/></Para><Para id="_544">Other studies show that patients with low-risk cytology and high-risk HPV infection
with types 16, 18, and 31 are more likely to have CIN or microinvasive histopathology on biopsy.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/>  One
method has also shown that integration of HPV types 16 and 18 into the genome,
leading to transcription of  viral and cellular messages, may predict
patients who are at greater risk of high-grade dysplasia and invasive
cancer.<Reference refidx="32"/></Para><Para id="_674">For women older than 30 years who are more likely to have persistent HPV infection, HPV typing can successfully triage women into high- and low-risk groups for CIN 3 or worse disease.  In this age group, HPV DNA testing is more effective than cytology alone in predicting the risk of developing CIN 3 or worse.<Reference refidx="33"/>  Other studies have shown the effectiveness of a primary HPV DNA–screening strategy with cytology triage over  the previously used cytology-based screening algorithms.<Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_285"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_3">The

surgicopathological staging study of patients with clinical stage IB disease
reported by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) GOG-49, the factors that most prominently predicted
 lymph node metastases and a decrease in disease-free
survival were capillary-lymphatic space involvement by tumor, increasing tumor
size, and increasing depth of stromal invasion, with the latter being the most
important and reproducible.<Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/></Para><Para id="_623">In a study of 1,028 patients treated with
radical surgery, survival rates correlated more consistently with tumor volume
(as determined by precise volumetry of the tumor) than with clinical or histological
stage.<Reference refidx="39"/></Para><Para id="_624">A multivariate analysis of prognostic variables in 626 patients with

nodes and suggested further evaluation of these nodes in locally advanced
cervical cancer. The status of the pelvic nodes was important only if the
periaortic nodes were negative.  This was also true for tumor size.</Para><Para id="_627">It is controversial whether
adenocarcinoma of the cervix carries a significantly worse prognosis than
squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.<Reference refidx="41"/>  Several population-based and retrospective studies showed a worse outcome for patients with adenocarcinoma, with an increase in distant metastasis compared with  those with squamous histology.<Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/> Reports
conflict about  the effect of adenosquamous cell type on outcome.<Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/>  One report
showed that approximately 25% of apparent squamous tumors have
demonstrable mucin production and behave more aggressively than their pure
squamous counterparts, suggesting that any adenomatous differentiation may
confer a negative prognosis.<Reference refidx="48"/>  </Para><Para id="_628">In a large
series of cervical cancer patients treated by radiation therapy, the incidence
of distant metastases (most frequently to the lung, abdominal cavity, liver, and
gastrointestinal tract) was shown to increase  as the stage of disease
increased, from 3% in stage IA to 75% in stage IVA.<Reference refidx="49"/>  A multivariate analysis of factors
influencing the incidence of distant metastases showed stage, endometrial
extension of tumor, and pelvic tumor control to be significant indicators of
distant dissemination.<Reference refidx="49"/></Para><Para id="_552">GOG studies have indicated that prognostic factors vary depending on whether clinical or surgical staging is used and with different treatments. Delay in radiation delivery completion is associated with poorer progression-free survival when clinical staging is used.

regional lymphatics, or bloodstream.  Tumor dissemination is generally a
function of the extent and invasiveness of the local lesion.  While cancer of
the cervix generally progresses in an orderly manner, occasionally a small
tumor with distant metastasis is seen.  For this reason, patients must be
carefully evaluated for metastatic disease.

curable disease may be indicated in select cases when a nonsurgical search for
metastatic disease is negative.  If abnormal nodes are detected by computed tomography (CT) scan or
lymphangiography, fine-needle aspiration should be negative before a surgical
