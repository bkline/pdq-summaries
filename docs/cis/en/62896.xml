Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) occur much less frequently in children than in adults and almost invariably represent clonal, preleukemic conditions that often evolve from congenital marrow failure syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.</Para><Para id="_945">The general characteristics of myeloid leukemias and other myeloid malignancies are described below:</Para><ItemizedList id="_946" Style="bullet"><ListItem><Strong>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)</Strong>. AML is a clonal disorder caused by malignant transformation of a bone marrow–derived, self-renewing stem cell or progenitors, leading to accumulation of immature, nonfunctional myeloid cells.  These events lead to increased accumulation of these malignant cells in the bone marrow and other organs.  To be called acute, the bone marrow usually must have greater than 20% immature leukemic blasts, with some exceptions.

Most importantly, TAM spontaneously regresses  within the first 3 months of life in most cases.

Less-intense therapeutic regimens are used and can reduce morbidity in these children with Down syndrome who experience greater toxicity than children without Down syndrome. However, children with Down syndrome who are older than 4 years most often have AML similar to children without Down syndrome (i.e., without the <GeneName>GATA1</GeneName> variant).

Initially, the French-American-British (FAB) classification system was created primarily based on morphologically distinct subgroups that were defined histochemically and, eventually, immunologically. The World Health Organization's (WHO) classification system for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was developed after the FAB system, and it is the primary system used now. The WHO classification was initially and primarily based on cytogenetics and morphology, and it now also uses molecular genetics. It has gone through several iterations, with the latest publication in 2022 (5th edition of the WHO Classification of Hematolymphoid Tumours: Myeloid and Histiocytic/Dendritic Neoplasms). A third classification system, the International Consensus Classification (ICC) of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemias, has been published and is primarily used as a tool for clinical trial development instead of clinical use.</Para><SummarySection id="_10"><Title>French-American-British (FAB) Classification System for Childhood AML</Title><Para id="_11">The first comprehensive morphological-histochemical classification system for

system at diagnosis, even in children with AML who
present with isolated chloromas (also called granulocytic or myeloid sarcomas).  These children invariably develop AML in months to years if they do not receive systemic chemotherapy.  AML may invade nonhematopoietic (extramedullary) tissue such as meninges,
brain parenchyma, testes or ovaries, or skin (leukemia cutis).  Extramedullary
leukemia is more common in infants than in older children with AML.<Reference refidx="2"/> In one retrospective analysis, leukemia cutis did not have an adverse impact on outcomes of infants when they were treated with traditional chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><SummarySection id="_175"><Title>Granulocytic sarcoma/chloroma</Title><Para id="_157">Granulocytic sarcoma (chloroma) describes extramedullary collections of leukemia cells. These collections can occur, albeit rarely, as the sole evidence of leukemia. In a review of three AML studies conducted by the former Children's Cancer Group, fewer than 1% of patients had isolated granulocytic sarcoma, and 11% had granulocytic sarcoma along with marrow disease at the time of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="4"/> This incidence was also seen in the <ProtocolRef nct_id="NCT00476541">NOPHO-AML 2004 (NCT00476541)</ProtocolRef> trial.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_1174">Patients with isolated granulocytic sarcoma have a good prognosis if treated with current AML therapy.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_567">In a study of 1,459 children with newly diagnosed  AML, patients with orbital granulocytic sarcoma and central nervous system (CNS) granulocytic sarcoma had better survival than patients with marrow disease and granulocytic sarcoma at other sites and AML patients without any extramedullary disease.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  Most patients with orbital granulocytic sarcoma have a t(8;21) abnormality, which has been associated with a favorable prognosis. The use of radiation therapy does not improve survival in patients with granulocytic sarcoma who have a complete response to chemotherapy.

These definitions include CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp)  and CR with incomplete marrow recovery (typically absolute neutrophil count) (CRi). Whereas the use of CRp provides a clinically meaningful response in studies of adults with AML, the traditional CR definition remains the gold standard because patients in CR were more likely to survive longer than those in CRp.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_938">Achieving a hypoplastic bone marrow (using morphology)
is usually the first step in obtaining remission in AML, with the
exception of the M3 subtype (acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL]). In APL, a hypoplastic marrow
phase is often not necessary before the achievement of remission. 
Additionally, early recovery marrows in any of the subtypes of AML may be
difficult to distinguish from persistent leukemia, although the application of flow cytometric immunophenotyping and cytogenetic/molecular testing have  made this less problematic. Correlation with blood
cell counts and clinical status is
imperative in passing final judgment on the results of early bone marrow
findings in AML.<Reference refidx="9"/> If the findings are in doubt, a bone marrow
aspirate should be repeated in 1 to 2 weeks.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_939">In addition to morphology, more precise methodology (e.g., multiparameter flow cytometry or quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) is used to assess response.

therapy may consist of varying numbers of courses of intensive chemotherapy
and/or allogeneic  hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).  For example,  the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) and the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) use similar chemotherapy regimens consisting of two courses of induction chemotherapy, followed by two to three additional courses of intensification chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_49">Maintenance chemotherapy is no longer part of pediatric AML protocols  because two randomized clinical trials failed to show a benefit for maintenance therapy when given after modern intensive chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/> Contemporary APL therapy also does not use maintenance chemotherapy. A tretinoin- and arsenic trioxide–based treatment is used instead.<Reference refidx="15"/> Maintenance therapy with targeted therapies is gaining interest. Treatment of patients with AML and <GeneName>FLT3</GeneName> internal tandem duplication (ITD) using sorafenib (a FLT3 inhibitor) during chemotherapy cycles and maintenance (following completion of chemotherapy or HSCT) significantly improved survival.<Reference refidx="16"/> </Para><Para id="_1092">Attention to both acute and long-term complications is critical in children with AML. Modern AML treatment approaches are usually associated with severe, protracted myelosuppression with related complications. Children with AML should receive care under the direction of pediatric oncologists in cancer centers or hospitals with appropriate supportive care facilities (e.g., specialized blood products; pediatric intensive care; provision of emotional and developmental support). With improved supportive care, toxic death constitutes a smaller proportion of initial therapy failures than in the past.<Reference refidx="10"/> Two COG trials reported an 11% to 13% incidence of remission failure, mainly  because of resistant disease. Only 2% to 3% resulted from toxic death during the two induction courses.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_1093">Children treated for AML are living longer and require close monitoring for cancer therapy side effects that may persist or develop months or years after treatment. The high cumulative doses of anthracyclines require long-term monitoring of cardiac function.

Because t-AML is rare in children, it is not known whether the significant decrease in transplant-related mortality after unrelated-donor HSCT noted over the past several years will translate to improved survival in this population.
