pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents

these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy.  Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.

These included variants in cohesin and cohesin-related proteins (43.6%), epigenetic regulators (39.2%), tyrosine kinases (25.5%), and genes important in the RAS pathway (11.8%). An additional 16 novel genes were also described. Of these, variants in two transcription factors (<GeneName>IRX1</GeneName>: 16.2%; <GeneName>ZBTB7A</GeneName>: 13.2%) were found, and functional studies confirmed their role as tumor suppressor genes that impacted signaling through MYC/E2F pathways. Structural variants were also observed. <GeneName>RUNX1</GeneName> partial tandem duplications were seen in 13.7% of patients, which may result in partial loss of function of the gene. This causes upregulation expression through the addition of an extra promoter, which results in isoform disequilibrium, with <GeneName>RUNX1A</GeneName> bias versus <GeneName>RUNX1</GeneName>. Recent studies have shown that this disequilibrium contributes to MLDS pathogenesis. Variants of <GeneName>RUNX1</GeneName>, <GeneName>IRX1</GeneName>, and <GeneName>ZBTB7A</GeneName> also activate MYC/E2F genes, suggesting that targeting this pathway may provide therapeutic benefit.<Reference refidx="20"/><ItemizedList id="_2011" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Four somatic alterations were associated with inferior outcomes in this study cohort. <ItemizedList id="_2013" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Of 177 patients with comprehensive somatic testing, <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> deletions and variants in <GeneName>ZBTB7A</GeneName>, <GeneName>TP53</GeneName>, and <GeneName>JAK2</GeneName> were all associated with inferior outcomes. </ListItem><ListItem>If patients had at least one of these variants, EFS and OS rates were significantly lower than those of patients who lacked any four of these abnormalities (3-year EFS rates, 66.6% vs. 94.2%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> for unadjusted Cox regression &lt; .001; 3-year OS rates, 69.0% vs. 95.6%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> for unadjusted Cox regression &lt; .001). </ListItem><ListItem>In multivariable analysis, all of these abnormalities were associated with inferior outcomes. </ListItem><ListItem>Validation of these findings in additional cohorts is needed.
