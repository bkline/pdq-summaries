Bone marrow can be used for autologous transplants, but PBSCs lead to quicker blood count recovery, resulting in less transplant-related toxicity.  </Para><Para id="_646">Patients being considered for autologous HSCT are generally given chemotherapy to determine tumor responsiveness and minimize the risk of tumor contamination in their bone marrow.  After a number of rounds of chemotherapy, patients undergo the leukapheresis procedure, either as their blood counts recover from chemotherapy or during a break between chemotherapy treatments.  Growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor are used to increase the number of circulating stem and progenitor cells (CD34+ cells).  Collection centers monitor the number of CD34-positive cells in the patient and product each day to determine the best time to begin collection and when collection is complete.  Patients with low numbers of  CD34-positive cells before collection can often have their cells successfully collected using alternative mobilization approaches (e.g., addition of plerixafor).<Reference refidx="1"/> The collected PBSCs are cryopreserved for later use. After completion of an intensive preparative regimen using high-dose chemotherapy, which varies according to the tumor type, the PBSCs are given to the patient at the time of transplant.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="25755177">Patel B, Pearson H, Zacharoulis S: Mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells in paediatric patients, prior to autologous transplantation following administration of plerixafor and G-CSF.
