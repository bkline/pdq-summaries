epithelial ovarian cancers.  Nearly 75% of borderline tumors are stage I at the time of
diagnosis.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Recognizing these tumors is important because their prognosis and
treatment is different from the frankly malignant invasive carcinomas. Ovarian borderline tumors can also become low-grade serous tumors. For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062829#_1518" url="/types/ovarian/hp/ovarian-epithelial-treatment-pdq">Treatment of Low-Grade Serous Carcinoma</SummaryRef> section in Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Treatment.</Para><Para id="_17">A review of 22 series (which included 953 patients), with a mean follow-up of 7 years, revealed
a survival rate of 92% for patients with advanced-stage ovarian borderline tumors, if patients with so-called
invasive implants were excluded.  The causes of death in these patients were determined to be
benign complications of disease (e.g., small bowel obstruction), complications
of therapy, and only rarely (0.7% of patients), malignant transformation.<Reference refidx="2"/>  In one
series, the 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year survival rates of patients with borderline tumors (all stages), as demonstrated by clinical life table
analysis, were 97%, 95%, 92%, and 89%, respectively.<Reference refidx="3"/>  In this series, mortality rates were stage
dependent:  0.7% of patients with stage I tumors, 4.2% of patients with stage II tumors, and 26.8% of patients with stage III tumors died of disease.<Reference refidx="3"/>   The Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique reported an extremely good prognosis for ovarian borderline tumors, with a 10-year survival rate of approximately 95%.<Reference refidx="1"/>  These survival rates are clearly in
contrast with the 30% survival rate for patients with invasive tumors (all stages).</Para><Para id="_318">Another large retrospective study showed that early stage, serous
histology, and younger age were associated with more favorable prognoses in patients with ovarian borderline tumors.<Reference refidx="4"/> 
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_60"><Title>Endometrioid Tumors</Title><Para id="_2">  Endometrioid borderline tumors are less common and should not be regarded as
malignant because  they seldom, if ever, metastasize.  However, malignant transformation
can occur and may be associated with a similar tumor outside of the
ovary. Such tumors are the result of either a second primary or rupture of the
primary endometrial tumor.<Reference refidx="5"/>
