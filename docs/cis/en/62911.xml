Changing epidemiological patterns in the United States regarding the anatomical location of esophagogastric cancers show a trend of decreased occurrence of distal or noncardia gastric cancers.<Reference refidx="2"/>  However, in people aged 25 to 39 years, there has been an increase in the incidence of noncardia gastric cancers,  from 0.27 cases per 100,000 individuals (1977–1981) to 0.45 cases per 100,000 individuals (2002–2006).<Reference refidx="2"/> Additional studies are needed to confirm the observed increases in noncardia gastric cancers in this specific age group.  </Para><Para id="_340">In contrast to the overall stable trend for noncardia gastric cancers, earlier studies demonstrated an increased incidence of adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia of 4% to 10% per year from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Similarly, the incidence of gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas increased sharply, from 1.22 cases per 100,000 individuals (1973–1978) to 2.00 cases per 100,000 individuals (1985–1990).<Reference refidx="4"/>  Since that time, the incidence has remained steady at 1.94 cases per 100,000 individuals  (2003–2008).<Reference refidx="4"/>  More recent data demonstrate that the incidence of gastric cardia cancers has been relatively stable, although an increase  has been observed, from 2.4 cases per 100,000 individuals (1977–1981) to 2.9 cases per 100,000 individuals (2001–2006) in the White population.<Reference refidx="2"/>  The reasons for these temporal changes in incidence are unclear.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_166"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_3">In the United States, gastric cancer ranks 15th in incidence among the major

</Para><Para id="_6">In localized distal gastric cancer, more than 50% of patients can be cured. 
However, early-stage disease accounts for only 10% to 20% of all cases
diagnosed in the United States.  The remaining patients present with metastatic
disease in either regional or distant sites.  The 5-year overall survival rate in
these patients ranges from almost no survival for patients with
disseminated disease to almost 50% survival for patients with localized distal
gastric cancers confined to resectable regional disease.  Even with apparent
localized disease, the 5-year survival rate of patients with proximal gastric
cancer is only 10% to 15%.  Although the treatment of patients with
disseminated gastric cancer may result in palliation of symptoms and some
prolongation of survival, long remissions are uncommon.
