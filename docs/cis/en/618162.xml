When possible, controlled/randomized data have been included. Communication research is also particularly vulnerable to bias and other confounders, an issue discussed further <SummaryRef href="CDR0000618162#_175" url="/about-cancer/coping/adjusting-to-cancer/communication-hp-pdq">below</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_184"><Strong>Communication</Strong>  involves an exchange of information and a means of connection between two people or parties. The relationship between the clinician and the patient embodies both aspects of communication. Patients with cancer desire information about their disease to make choices about cancer treatment and, ultimately, to live their lives more fully. In addition, most patients look to their oncologist and other cancer clinicians  for  guidance and support.  Frequently, the information that oncologists share with patients is serious in nature and may evoke strong emotions from patients and caregivers.  Effective communication requires oncologists to convey information in a manner that patients can understand, manage emotional responses to the information provided, and help patients make sound medical decisions.</Para><Para id="_357">Patient-clinician communication is defined by its bidirectional nature, with each participant giving and receiving information. Patients and their families are often greatly invested in their personal relationship with their oncologist, and the intensity and longitudinal nature of these relationships is likewise an aspect that attracts many clinicians to the field of oncology.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_174"><Title>Goals and Importance of Communication </Title><Para id="_175">Effective communication may impact health outcomes, though it remains challenging to demonstrate direct causal relationships between communication techniques and outcomes and/or identify the precise elements of patient-provider communication in oncology that result in improved physical, emotional, and other health care outcomes. Although the body of oncology-specific communication research is growing, level I evidence supporting specific tools or interventions from randomized controlled trials remains limited.  Notably, studies on communication may have several confounders, including recall bias, self-reporting bias, and multiple influences on understanding. Communication research also suffers from a lack of standardized and validated communication assessment measures, while rigid and/or specific approaches to communication may fail to adapt to social and cultural differences in communication. </Para><Para id="_185">Despite these challenges in the literature, investigators have proposed links between  good patient-centered communication skills—focused on defining and attending to the specific information needs of the patient, fostering trusting relationships, and addressing both cognitive and emotional needs in communication—with the following patient- and system-related outcomes:<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_186" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Enhanced patient satisfaction.<Reference refidx="2"/></ListItem><ListItem>Increased quality of life.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/></ListItem><ListItem>Reduced patient anxiety and improved symptom control.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></ListItem><ListItem>Adherence with treatment recommendations.<Reference refidx="8"/></ListItem><ListItem>Enhanced accrual to clinical trials.<Reference refidx="9"/></ListItem><ListItem>Improved disease-related understanding.<Reference refidx="10"/></ListItem><ListItem>Improved prognostic awareness.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/></ListItem><ListItem>Receipt of care consistent with the patient's stated preferences, particularly at the end of life.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/></ListItem><ListItem>Decreased oncologist stress and burnout.<Reference refidx="14"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_187">Conversely, there is also evidence to suggest that patient dissatisfaction with poor communication may lead to negative outcomes, such as increased malpractice suits.

The topics and verbal or nonverbal communication behaviors that reliably lead to desirable consequences—or away from undesirable consequences—remain largely a matter of speculation, despite a proliferation of communication skills training interventions and a growing number of empirical studies. The question, however, is of great importance to the interested oncology clinician. The consensus is that the current status of patient–oncology clinician communication is suboptimal and often leads to undesirable consequences for the patient.</Para><Para id="_471">For example, an often-cited, large, cross-sectional study of patients with advanced-stage cancer demonstrated that only 38% recalled discussing their end of life (EOL) preferences with a clinician. Those who did were less likely to receive intensive medical treatments (intubation, resuscitation, and intensive care unit admissions) and more likely to enroll in hospice. Furthermore, more aggressive medical treatment was associated with lower quality of life.<Reference refidx="1"/> Many other observational studies confirm the low rate of conversations about EOL and the negative consequences of not having these conversations. Left unanswered is the question of what clinicians can do differently to improve health care behaviors and outcomes. For more information, see  <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/end-of-life-hp-pdq">Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_198">Oncology clinicians acknowledge that they feel unprepared for communication with patients, especially those who may be near the EOL. They identify as additional impediments inadequate time during the average clinic visit for these difficult conversations and the emotional challenges inherent in these conversations. Communication skills training can increase clinicians’ confidence, improve certain communication behaviors, and lead to better patient satisfaction.<Reference refidx="2"/>  However, these and other interventions do not consistently improve other measures of communication or actual health care choices and consequences.</Para><Para id="_199">One explanation for the limited impact of communication interventions on patient outcomes is that models of patient-oncologist communication may not accurately reflect what happens before, during, and after encounters between patients and oncology clinicians. There are several reasons this may be the case:  </Para><ItemizedList id="_472" Style="bullet"><ListItem>First, models reflect an ideal. In some cases, the ideal is based on ethical principles derived from research oversight rather than clinical medicine.<Reference refidx="3"/> Informed consent is one example of a model based on what should happen rather than what may actually be happening.</ListItem><ListItem>Second, models represent the potential relationships between variables of interest. A model may reasonably describe what happens with the measured variables but not accurately capture what happens during communication and the mechanisms that link it to outcomes.<Reference refidx="4"/></ListItem><ListItem>Third, definitions and measures of communication quality are not standardized.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> Measures of patient, caregiver, and clinician perceptions of communication assess participants’ subjective experiences and likely capture constructs that are distinct from the content of the communication encounter. Objective assessment of communication content and behavior requires investigators to manually code audio or video tapes of patient-clinician communication encounters, a process that may be perceived as intrusive by research participants and resource-intensive by investigators.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_473">Many but not all studies, for example, suggest that patient expectations or prognostic understanding influence treatment decisions.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> The different definitions and measures of prognostic expectations, however, may mean that related but unidentified factors are important.<Reference refidx="9"/> Finally, often the data are derived from cross-sectional studies. Causal inferences are common but may not be accurate absent confirmation in a well-designed prospective trial.</Para><Para id="_457">That said, models are potentially useful heuristics, problem-solving techniques that use self-education to improve performance. They provide oncology clinicians with a broad sense of the goals of communication and required skills. Familiarity with the more common models also gives oncology clinicians a framework to evaluate new data and modify their approach to communication. This section describes and evaluates briefly the two dominant models of communication: shared decision making and patient-centered communication. Each model has advantages and provides a potential road map to better communication. No data allow clinicians to favor one model over another.</Para><Para id="_458">It is worthwhile to mention two less commonly discussed but potentially important models. The first is Cognitive-Emotional Decision Making (CEDM). One review proposed CEDM based on the potential interaction between emotions and cognition during decision making.<Reference refidx="10"/> The authors’ model synthesized three well-established concepts. First, emotions inform patients’ decisions. The idea that decision making is a cognitive exercise in which the patient compares the relative risks and benefits of options is incomplete. Patients often use emotional cues—what they are feeling—to evaluate the relative importance of the risks and benefits. Second, people cope with health threats by evaluating the salience of the threat and the resources available to meet the threat. Third, people develop internal representations of the meaning of illness, and their representations influence how they evaluate and adhere to recommendations. There has not yet been empirical testing of the CEDM model. However, the model warrants mention since it recognizes emotion and coping as intrinsically relevant to the decision-making process.</Para><Para id="_459">The second type of model focuses on explaining the causes of behavior change. Social Cognitive Theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior are two examples.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/> Their relevance comes from the idea that if improvements in communication are to lead to improvements in health care outcomes, then we must understand how communication changes behaviors. For example, how do conversations lead a patient to forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation and enroll in hospice? The models recognize that people seek positive outcomes while they try to avoid negative outcomes. Communication is one influence on the patient’s deliberations around strategies and efforts to prepare for change and then act accordingly. The models further posit that there are several modifiable mediators, e.g., knowledge, beliefs, perceived communication competence, and skills, to effect behavior change.</Para><SummarySection id="_202"><Title>Shared Decision Making  </Title><Para id="_203">Shared decision making (SDM) was an ideal initially proposed to engage the patient in health care decisions. Prior to that, physicians tended to act as if they alone had the information necessary to formulate a diagnostic and treatment plan independent of the patient but in the patient’s best medical interest. In contrast, SDM models rest on the premise that both patients and clinicians make essential contributions to the decision-making process. Neither knows enough to make a sound decision independent of the other. Clinicians are experts in diseases and treatments. Patients are experts in their values and the trade-offs they are willing to accept. Clinicians may describe options for treatment or care and the anticipated benefits or harms, including their likelihood. However, only the patient can determine the importance of the benefits and harms since such judgments require some sense of the patient’s values and goals.</Para><Para id="_461">Widespread integration of SDM into patient-oncologist communication has lagged for several reasons. First, there is no consensus about what verbal and nonverbal communication behaviors are essential to SDM. Systematic reviews of the relevant literature published in 2006 and 2019 concluded that there is no unified model of SDM.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/> The 2019 publication identified 53 different elements mentioned in at least one of the 40 articles analyzed. The most common elements included: make the decision, elicit and integrate patient preferences, tailor information, and deliberate about options and their benefits and harms with the patient.</Para><Para id="_467">A second reason relates to patients’ general satisfaction with communication, regardless of whether there is evidence of SDM. For example,  investigators followed 14 patients with advanced cancer with in-depth interviews and observations of outpatient clinic visits.<Reference refidx="15"/> They found little evidence of SDM; however, patients rated communication encounters favorably.</Para><Para id="_468">A third reason relates to uncertainty about the best way to train clinicians in SDM behaviors and support implementation. The training question will likely remain relevant absent a consensus about the key attitudes and skills necessary to introduce SDM into clinical encounters. Many tools to support SDM, such as decision aids, have been tested and generally show improvement in measures of patient satisfaction and reduction in decisional conflict. These effects are modest, and improvements in patterns and consequences of health care choices are rarely seen.<Reference refidx="16"/> In addition, decision aids and other tools are not widely used.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_469">At present, SDM is essentially a laudable goal of communication in search of a method. Few would disagree that patients should be fully informed of the options and their potential harms and benefits to the extent that they desire. Once informed, patients then should have an opportunity to integrate their values and goals into their choices.<Reference refidx="18"/> Clinicians can play a valuable role in SDM by helping patients  recognize the implications of each option for the patient’s values and goals.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_462"><Title>Patient-Centered Communication</Title><Para id="_463">The National Cancer Institute commissioned communication scholars Ronald Epstein and Richard Street to evaluate the status of patient-centered communication in cancer care as part of its strategic plan to integrate social, psychological, and communication research with biomedical research. The resulting monograph presents an aspirational and comprehensive model of what patient-centered communication might accomplish. This model proposes six core functions of communication: foster healing relationships, exchange information, respond to emotion, manage uncertainty, make decisions, and enable patient self-management.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_464">The most direct evaluation of the impact of patient-centered communication on patient outcomes is the Values and Options in Cancer Care (VOICE) trial.<Reference refidx="21"/> The design of the intervention and the outcome measures were based on Street’s Ecological Model of Patient-Centered Communication and four key communication goals (engaging patients and caregivers, responding to patient concerns, informing patients about treatment choices, and framing prognosis). The model suggests that interventions should target the mutual interactions between patients and oncologists rather than focusing on individual communication behaviors. In addition, the intervention should be sensitive to the social and clinical contexts relevant to the success of the intervention. </Para><Para id="_470">The VOICE trial was a cluster randomized clinical trial conducted at multiple clinics. A total of 118 patients were enrolled in the prerandomization period and 265 patients after physician randomization to either the intervention (n = 130) or control (n = 135) groups. The primary outcome was a composite measure based on an analysis of audio recordings of clinical encounters. The composite measure scored behaviors related to patient engagement and evidence of clinicians responding to emotion, informing patients about prognosis and treatment choice, and providing balanced information. The secondary outcomes included proximal measures of communication outcomes, e.g., the human connection scale, and distal outcomes such as aggressive treatment or hospice enrollment. The intervention improved communication behaviors, as assessed by the composite measure, without changing secondary outcomes.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_465"><Title>Conclusions</Title><Para id="_466">Models of communication articulate laudable goals and provide a high-level road map for communication in cancer care. Patients, caregivers, clinicians, and researchers seem to share a common understanding of the goals.<Reference refidx="22"/> The missing details, however, hamper the development of curricula and effective interventions. In the meantime, clinicians may choose to organize or explain their communication strategies using models and modify as new evidence clarifies the communication behaviors that are most impactful.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="18840840">Wright AA, Zhang B, Ray A, et al.: Associations between end-of-life discussions, patient mental health, medical care near death, and caregiver bereavement adjustment.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines personal health literacy as “the degree to which individuals have the ability to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others.” Low health literacy has been frequently linked to worse health outcomes. Cancer patients with low health literacy may misunderstand details of their disease or treatment plan, which may, in turn, contribute to over- or under-treatment and poor adherence to a treatment plan.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_409">Health literacy is distinct from general literacy, though it is important to note that health information is often presented at a relatively advanced reading level. Lower education levels are associated with poor health literacy, but providers should not assume that patients with high educational attainment also have high health literacy, as many do not.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/>  Older age has also been associated with poor health literacy.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_410">Various working groups and studies have sought to identify best practices for communicating with patients with low literacy skills. Recommendations include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_411" Style="bullet">

One study examined the phenomenon of avoidance of family communication about cancer.<Reference refidx="34"/> In this study, interviews with 50 caregivers and 26 families were audiotaped and transcribed. Two-thirds of families (65%) experienced communication difficulties. Participants’ narratives pointed to three distinct thought processes that contributed to the phenomenon of avoidance: avoidance of psychological distress, desire for mutual protection against harmful situations, and belief in positive thinking.</Para><Para id="_422">In a randomized trial, investigators interviewed male and female cancer patients and asked how the family was affected by the cancer diagnosis. Almost all expressed the importance of concealing feelings of distress and unhappiness, stemming from a need to protect family and friends and to act normal. Also important were factors such as maintaining or returning to familiar routines and roles.<Reference refidx="35"/> </Para><Para id="_423">Opening up lines of communication and encouraging mutual disclosure about cancer-related issues may be effective at reducing distress in relationships for cancer patients.

The study data was gathered from a large randomized controlled trial examining the effect of family-focused grief therapy on family bereavement outcomes. In the study, 257 patients and family members reported on their perception of cancer-related communication after each therapy session using a self-disclosure scale. Participants reported more cancer-related communication on average during therapy sessions compared with baseline; however, the long-term therapeutic effects on depressive symptoms and bereavement in family members depended on the listener's perceived responsiveness (responsiveness defined as “to what degree participants perceived the family as caring, understanding, and accepting of their communication”). Participants who perceived their families as highly responsive had lower depression and bereavement scores after the patient’s death if they had more cancer-related communication in the therapy sessions, while more communication was actually associated with worse bereavement outcomes for families who perceived low responsiveness.<Reference refidx="37"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">level of evidence: I</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_425">Expectations for the role of family members in cancer care and communication with the patient and providers regarding the disease course and treatment plan vary among cultures, as well. Some cultures place greater emphasis on communication with the family unit as a whole, while others focus more on individual patient independence and autonomy.

A 2003 survey of U.S. medical, radiation, and surgical oncology programs revealed that only one-third of programs reported offering communication skills training. Lack of faculty time and expertise were identified as the major barriers.<Reference refidx="2"/> Similarly, in a survey by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, few attending oncologists reported receiving mentoring or specific training in communication skills, such as discussing prognosis.<Reference refidx="3"/> Furthermore, while communication is taught to fellows, the quality of that teaching may be inferior. In a national survey of hematology-oncology fellows, 55% reported explicit education on end-of-life communication. However, fellows reported less observation and feedback on a communication skill than on a bone marrow biopsy.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_363">The lack of training is concerning, given how frequently oncologists engage in difficult communication tasks.

Key aspects of communication skills training include opportunities for learners to practice skills and receive feedback. Optimal duration is not known, and no studies compared shorter versus longer workshops to see whether there is a dose-response curve. The need for consolidation or booster lessons after the initial workshop is unclear, with some studies demonstrating substantially better outcomes and uptake of behaviors with additional lessons or consolidation workshops.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="31"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_297"><Title>Communication Tools and Techniques</Title><Para id="_298">Some of the training referenced above focuses on specific tools to facilitate recollection and application or transfer of skills into clinical encounters. Evidence linking these tools to provider- or patient-related outcomes is extremely sparse, but as they are commonly used in practice, they have been included here.

What is clear is that not discussing the diagnosis may engender in patients feelings of isolation, anxiety, lack of autonomy or control, psychological abandonment, mistrust, suspicion, and a sense of betrayal. On the other hand, open discussion of the diagnosis decreases uncertainty, improves participation in decisions about care, allows access to psychological support, encourages self-care, and allows planning for the future.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_314">In an innovative qualitative study focused on communicating bad news related to cancer recurrence,<Reference refidx="7"/> patients with diagnoses of gastrointestinal cancers during the previous 2 years listened to audio recordings of oncologists using the SPIKES (Setting, Perception, Invitation, Knowledge, Empathy, Summary) approach (with standardized actors) and then identified what they liked and disliked about the communication.

In an analysis of physician surveys from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium,<Reference refidx="25"/> investigators  reported that patients with metastatic lung or colorectal cancer were more likely to have an accurate prognostic awareness if their most important doctor reported discussing prognosis earlier rather than waiting for deterioration (18.5% vs. 7.6%; odds ratio, 3.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.39–7.52; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .006). Thus, understanding the factors that influence oncologists’ attitudes is relevant to improving prognostic communication. Two additional surveys of American oncologists and communication about prognosis have been published. One study analyzed the survey responses of 729 oncologists (64% response rate).<Reference refidx="26"/> Almost all (98%) indicated they would disclose a terminal prognosis, but 48% indicated they would do so only when the patient’s preference for disclosure of prognosis was known.

The choices can range from curative to palliative treatment, from surgery to radiation to chemotherapy, all with a broad potential side effect profile that could be either short- or long-term. There is increasing research into how providers approach treatment conversations with patients and how to actively involve them and to make sure their preferences are an important part of treatment decision making. </Para><Para id="_325">The ASCO published a consensus guideline for patient-clinician communication. In addition to guidance regarding core communication skills and tasks that apply across the continuum of cancer care, recommendations address specific topics, such as discussion of goals of care and prognosis, treatment selection, EOL care, facilitating family involvement in care, and clinician training in communication skills. Recommendations are accompanied by suggested strategies for implementation.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_326">When considering how to approach discussions about cancer-directed therapy with a patient, a provider should take into account the patient’s preferred approach to decision making. In a meta-analysis, 26% of patients preferred active roles, 49% preferred collaborative roles, and 25% preferred passive roles in treatment decision making.<Reference refidx="28"/> Forty percent of patients in the study had discordance between their preferred communication role and their experience in the clinic setting. Evaluation of a patient’s preferred communication style should be considered at initial intake so that clinicians can use the preferred style during patient encounters for treatment decision making.</Para><Para id="_327">Patients with colon and breast cancer were given questionnaires directly after a consultation with their oncologist and then 3 months later. The questionnaires assessed their preferred and perceived decision-making styles, physician empathy, and shared decision making and the impact on patients’ decision regret.<Reference refidx="29"/> Greater physician  empathy was significantly associated with more shared decision making and less decision regret. If patients participated less than they desired in their visits, they reported more decision regret with their follow-up. This finding emphasizes the need for physician empathy, as well as the need to match patients’ preferred and perceived roles in medical decision making to enhance treatment decision making and minimize regret.</Para><Para id="_328">Patients who are candidates for palliative treatment alone can face different barriers to shared decision making. Faced with treatment that is not curative, some patients prefer to know less, and others desire significantly more information about treatment side effects, response rate, and prognosis. Clinical factors are the primary indicator for treatment options that an oncologist presents, but if all clinical factors are even, emotion is a strong influence. When chemotherapy near the EOL is being considered, oncologists feel that patients drive the desire for the treatment.<Reference refidx="30"/>  Despite that, the majority of patients in another study clearly desired to receive information on tumor response (91%) and survival benefit (74%).

Communication about cancer treatment costs have been limited by the lack of education in medical school about health care systems, quality improvement, and medical economics. This gap impacts the physician’s ability to integrate comparative effectiveness into medical decision making.<Reference refidx="33"/>  Compounding this deficiency is the variability of health care costs and insurance drug coverage, resulting in a lack of transparency in the cost of cancer care.

While most adolescents and young adults were satisfied with the amount of prognostic information they received, a sizable minority (19%–21%) desired additional information.<Reference refidx="23"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] A study of teens with advanced cancer suggested not only that they are capable of participating in complex decision making, but also that nearly all understand the consequences of their end-of-life (EOL) decisions and care about how they affect surviving friends and family.<Reference refidx="24"/> Finally, a study of bereaved caregivers of adolescents and young adults cited delayed or absent communication about prognosis as a barrier to optimal EOL care.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_353"><Title>Communication With Siblings</Title><Para id="_354">Siblings of children with cancer experience psychosocial distress during cancer therapy and after bereavement.   In a  study of 174 siblings of children who died of cancer, the siblings reported poor knowledge and experienced a lack of communication about the death of their brother or sister.  Siblings who reported a lack of communication surrounding the death of their brother or sister reported higher levels of anxiety 2 to 9 years after the loss.<Reference refidx="26"/>   Of these 174 bereaved siblings, 108 participated in a survey in which 56% suggested that providers communicate better medical information.  Other suggestions included giving parents more guidance on how to communicate with siblings and incorporate them into the care of the patient with cancer.<Reference refidx="27"/> Similarly, a cross-sectional, survey-based study of bereaved siblings reported dissatisfaction with communication as a factor in higher distress scores.<Reference refidx="28"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_355"><Title>Communication With a Child Whose Parent Has Cancer</Title><Para id="_356">A child whose parent has a diagnosis of advanced cancer experiences high levels of distress.  A study of 28 families indicated that children wanted honest information from a variety of sources, including health professionals, and access to confidential conversations to avoid upsetting the ill parent.<Reference refidx="29"/>    In another study, 279 fathers widowed by cancer completed a survey about their own depression and bereavement symptoms, their wife’s illness, and EOL parental communication priorities.  The study supports the importance of parental communication with children about death. Parents with terminal cancer identified illness-related communication with children as a source of concern, and many reported that they lacked the necessary confidence or information to effectively communicate with their children.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Field MJ, Behrman RE, eds.: When Children Die: Improving Palliative and End-of-Life Care for Children and Their Families.
