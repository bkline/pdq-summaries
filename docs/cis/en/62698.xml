adults.  Review of data from the National Cancer Institute's National Childhood Cancer Registry resulted in an estimated osteosarcoma incidence rate of 5.4 cases per 1 million each year in people aged  0 to 19 years and 4 cases per 1 million each year in people younger than 40 years.<Reference refidx="1"/> The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that there were 82 million people between the ages of 0 and 19 years, resulting in an incidence of roughly 440 cases per year in this age group. </Para><Para id="_1803">Osteosarcoma accounts for approximately 5% of childhood tumors.  In
children and adolescents, more than 50% of these tumors arise from the long bones around the
knee. Osteosarcoma is rarely observed in soft tissue or visceral organs. There appears to be no difference in presenting symptoms, tumor location, and outcome for younger patients (&lt;12 years) compared with adolescents.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> </Para><Para id="_1804">Two trials conducted in the 1980s were designed to determine whether chemotherapy altered the natural history of osteosarcoma after surgical removal of the primary tumor.  The outcome of these patients recapitulated the historical
experience before 1970. More than one-half of these patients developed metastases
within 6 months of diagnosis, and overall,  approximately 90% developed recurrent
disease within 2 years of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="4"/>    Overall survival (OS) for patients
treated with surgery alone was statistically inferior.<Reference refidx="5"/>  The natural history
of osteosarcoma has not changed over time, and fewer than 20% of patients with
localized, resectable primary tumors treated  with surgery alone can be expected
to survive free of relapse.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="6"/>; <Reference refidx="7"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000810017" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence A1</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_1926">In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an update to the Classification of Tumors of Soft Tissue and Bone.<Reference refidx="8"/>  They removed the term malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and replaced it with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS).  This type of sarcoma is much more common in soft tissues. However, it does arise in bone.  In bone, it has features that are histologically similar to osteosarcoma, but  it does not produce osteoid.  Most of the literature describing the clinical behavior and response to therapy for this histology in bone was published before the 2013 WHO update, and a search for UPS of bone will not retrieve these articles.  The citations in this summary appear with their titles as published. Therefore, many references will describe MFH of bone, a condition now called UPS of bone.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1822"><Title>Diagnostic Evaluation</Title><Para id="_247">Osteosarcoma can be diagnosed by core needle biopsy or open surgical biopsy. It is preferable that the biopsy be performed by a surgeon skilled in the techniques of limb sparing (removal of the malignant bone tumor without amputation and replacement of bones or joints with allografts or prosthetic devices). In these cases, the original biopsy incision placement is crucial. Inappropriate alignment of the biopsy or inadvertent contamination of soft tissues can render subsequent limb-preserving reconstructive surgery impossible.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_363"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_87">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.
