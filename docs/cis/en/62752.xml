About 60% of oral/pharyngeal cancers are moderately advanced (regional stage) or metastatic at the time of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="2"/> The 5-year relative survival rate is 69%.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_62">The estimated annual worldwide number of cases of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers is about 275,000, with an approximate 20-fold variation geographically.<Reference refidx="3"/>   South and Southeast Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh), France, and Brazil have particularly high rates.  In most countries, men have higher rates of oral cavity cancer than women (caused by tobacco use) and higher rates of lip cancer (caused by sunlight exposure from outdoor occupations).<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_102">Nasopharyngeal cancers are rare in the United States, with an annual incidence rate of 0.7 cases per 100,000 persons.<Reference refidx="4"/> However, there are marked geographic differences, with an overall incidence in China that is 40- to 380-fold higher than that in the United States.<Reference refidx="4"/> There are elevated rates of nasopharyngeal cancers in the Cantonese population of southern China (including Hong Kong), and intermediate rates are observed in several indigenous populations in Southeast Asia and in natives of the Arctic region, North Africa, and the Middle East. First-generation Chinese immigrants to the United States maintain a high incidence rate, while their descendants born in the United States show a decreased incidence. The 5-year survival rate for keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, the most common subtype of nasopharyngeal cancer in the United States, is 46%.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2025.

Oral cavity cancers occur in a region of the body that is generally accessible to physical examination by the patient, the dentist, and the physician. Visual examination is the most common method used to detect visible lesions. Other methods have been used to augment clinical detection of oral lesions and include toluidine blue, brush biopsy, and fluorescence staining.</Para><Para id="_63"> An inspection of the oral cavity is often part of a physical examination in a dentist's or physician's office.  Of note, high-risk individuals visit their medical doctors more
frequently than they visit their dentists. Although physicians are more likely to provide risk-factor counseling (such as tobacco cessation), they are less likely than dentists to perform an oral cancer examination.<Reference refidx="3"/> Overall, only a fraction (~20%) of Americans receive an oral cancer examination.  Black patients,    Hispanic patients, and those who have a lower level of education are less likely to have such an examination, perhaps because they   lack access to medical care.<Reference refidx="3"/>    An
oral examination often includes looking for leukoplakia and erythroplakia
lesions, which can progress to cancer.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  One  study has shown that direct  fluorescence visualization (using a simple hand-held device in the operating room) could identify subclinical high-risk fields with cancerous or precancerous changes extending up to 25 mm beyond the primary tumor in 19 of 20 patients undergoing oral surgery for invasive or <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> squamous cell tumors.<Reference refidx="6"/> However, this finding has not yet been tested in a screening setting.    Data suggest that molecular
markers may be useful in the prognosis of these premalignant oral
lesions.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_65">The routine examination of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients can lead to detection of earlier-stage cancers and premalignant lesions. There is no definitive evidence, however, to show that this screening can reduce oral cancer mortality, and there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in any Western or other low-risk populations.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_66">In a single RCT of screening versus usual care, 13 geographic clusters in the Trivandrum district of Kerala, India, were randomly assigned to receive systematic oral visual screening by trained health workers (seven screened clusters, six control clusters) every 3 years for four screening rounds between 1996 and 2008.  During a 15-year follow-up period, there were 138 deaths from oral cancer in the screening group, with a cause-specific mortality rate of 15.4 per 100,000 person-years, and 154 deaths in the control group, with a  mortality rate of 17.1 per  100,000  person-years (relative risk [RR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69–1.12).  In a subset analysis restricted to tobacco or alcohol users, the mortality rates were 30 and 39 per 100,000 person-years, respectively (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.97).  There was no apparent adjustment of the CIs for the cluster design.  In another subgroup analysis, mortality hazard ratios were calculated for groups defined by number of times screened, but the inappropriate comparison in each case was to the control group of the whole study. No data on treatment of oral cancers were presented.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_67">Aside from the issues of generalizability to other populations and lack of an overall statistically significant result in cause-specific mortality, interpretation of the results is made difficult by serious lacks in methodological  detail about the randomization process, allocation concealment, adjustment for clustering effect, and information about treatment.  The total number of clusters randomized was small, and there were different distributions of income and household possessions between the two study arms.  Withdrawals and dropouts were not clearly described.  In summary, the sole randomized trial does not provide solid evidence of a cause-specific mortality benefit associated with systematic oral cavity visual examination.</Para><Para id="_76">Techniques such as toluidine blue staining, brush biopsy/cytology, or fluorescence imaging as the primary screening tool or as an adjunct for screening have not been shown to have superior sensitivity and specificity for visual examination alone or to yield better health outcomes.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="16"/>   In an RCT conducted in Keelung County, Taiwan, 7,975 individuals at high risk of oral cancer due to cigarette smoking or betel-quid chewing were randomly assigned to receive a one-time oral cancer examination after gargling with toluidine blue or a blue placebo dye.<Reference refidx="17"/>   The positive test rates were 9.5% versus 8.3%, respectively (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .047).  The detection of premalignant lesions was not statistically different (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74–1.41).  The number of overall oral cancers diagnosed within the short follow-up period of 5 years was too small for valid comparison (six in each group).</Para><Para id="_69">The operating characteristics of the various techniques used as an adjunct to oral visual examination are not well established.  A systematic literature review of toluidine blue, a variety of other visualization adjuncts, and cytopathology in the screening setting revealed a very broad range of reported sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values when biopsy confirmation was used as the gold standard outcome.<Reference refidx="18"/>   In part, this range of findings can be attributed to varying study populations, sample size and settings, and criteria for positive-clinical examinations and for scoring a biopsy as positive.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_99"><Title>Screening for Nasopharyngeal Cancer</Title><Para id="_100">Serum Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–associated antibodies and circulating cell-free EBV DNA testing have  been used for nasopharyngeal cancer diagnosis and screening. In an observational study of 20,349 men aged 40 to 62 years, circulating cell-free EBV DNA testing was used to screen for nasopharyngeal cancer.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/> A total of 1.5% of participants tested positive twice for EBV DNA and had further workup, leading to a diagnosis of nasopharyngeal cancer for 34 patients. The EBV DNA test had a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% CI, 95.5%–98.7%) and specificity of 98.6% (95% CI, 98.6%–98.7%). Without a control group, the study compared stage of disease at diagnosis with a historical cohort and found a higher proportion of stage I and stage II disease (71% vs. 20%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001) and superior 3-year progression-free survival in the screen-detected population. However, the survival benefit in the study may also be caused by lead-time bias.  </Para><Para id="_101">Other screening programs in southern China use EBV-associated antibodies, but their effects are difficult to determine because of lack of controls for comparison of survival outcomes.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/> In summary, current screening studies for nasopharyngeal cancer do not provide solid evidence of a benefit associated with screening for nasopharyngeal cancer, especially in nonendemic regions such as the United States.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Opportunistic oral cancer screening: a management strategy for dental practice.
