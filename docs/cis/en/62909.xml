It usually occurs in sun-exposed areas of skin, with the nose being the most common site. Although there are many different clinical presentations for BCC, the most characteristic type is the asymptomatic nodular or nodular ulcerative lesion that is elevated from the surrounding skin, has a pearly quality, and contains telangiectatic vessels. </Para><Para id="_219">BCCs are composed of nonkeratinizing cells derived from the basal cell layer of the epidermis.  They are slow growing and rarely metastasize.  BCC tends to be locally destructive and can result in serious deforming damage if left untreated or if local recurrences cannot be completely excised.  High-risk areas for tumor recurrence after initial treatment include the central face (e.g., periorbital region, eyelids, nasolabial fold, or nose-cheek angle), postauricular region, pinna, ear canal, forehead, and scalp.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_491">Morpheaform type is a specific BCC subtype. This subtype typically appears as a scar-like, firm plaque. Because of indistinct clinical tumor margins, morpheaform type is difficult to treat adequately with traditional treatments.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_558">BCCs often have a characteristic variant in the <GeneName>PTCH1</GeneName> tumor suppressor gene, although the mechanism of carcinogenesis is not clear.<Reference refidx="1"/> </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_179"><Title>Squamous cell carcinoma</Title><Para id="_180">People with chronic sun damage, history of sunburns, arsenic exposure, chronic cutaneous inflammation (as seen in long-standing skin ulcers), and previous radiation therapy are predisposed to the development of SCC. SCCs tend to occur on sun-exposed portions of the skin, such as the ears, lower lip, and dorsa of the hands. SCCs that develop from actinic keratosis on sun-exposed skin are less likely to metastasize and these patients have a better prognosis than those who develop de novo SCCs or SCCs on non–sun-exposed skin.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_181">SCCs are composed of keratinizing cells.  These tumors are more aggressive than BCCs and have a range of growth, invasive, and metastatic potential.  Prognosis is associated with the degree of differentiation, and tumor grade is reported as part of the staging system.<Reference refidx="10"/>  A four-grade system (G1–G4) is most common, but two- and three-grade systems may also be used.</Para><Para id="_559">Variants in the <GeneName>PTCH1</GeneName> tumor suppressor gene have been reported in SCCs  removed from patients with a prior history of multiple BCCs.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_182">SCC <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> (also called Bowen disease) is a noninvasive lesion.  Distinguishing SCC <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> pathologically from a benign inflammatory process may be difficult.<Reference refidx="1"/>   The risk of development into invasive SCC is low, reportedly in the range of 3% to 4%.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_183"><Title>Actinic keratosis</Title><Para id="_184">Actinic keratoses are potential precursors of SCC, but the rate of progression is extremely low, and most do not become SCCs. These typically red, scaly patches usually arise on areas of chronically sun-exposed skin and are likely to be found on the face and dorsal aspects of the hand. </Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_492"><Title>Diagnostic and Staging Evaluation</Title><Para id="_493">BCC and SCC are usually diagnosed based on routine histopathology obtained from a shave, punch, incisional, or excisional biopsy.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_494">Other tests and procedures that may be used to diagnose and stage BCC and SCC of the skin include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_495" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Physical examination, including skin examination and history.</ListItem><ListItem>Chest x-ray.</ListItem><ListItem>Computed tomography (CT) scan or positron emission tomography (PET)–CT scan of the head and neck or chest.</ListItem><ListItem>Ultrasonography of the regional lymph nodes.</ListItem><ListItem>Lymph node biopsy.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><Para id="_557">Ophthalmic examination or evaluation is performed to diagnose and stage eyelid carcinoma.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Reszko A, Aasi SZ, Wilson LD, et al.: Cancer of the skin.

approaches for treating basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin, including excision, radiation therapy, cryosurgery, electrodesiccation and curettage, photodynamic or laser-beam light exposure, and topical therapies.  Each of these approaches is useful in specific clinical situations. Depending on case selection, these approaches produce recurrence-free rates ranging from 85% to 95%.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_226">A systematic review of 27 randomized controlled trials comparing various treatments for BCC has been published.<Reference refidx="10"/> Eighteen of the studies were published in full, and nine were published in abstract form only. Only 19 of the 27 trials were analyzed by intention-to-treat criteria.  Because the case fatality rate of BCC is so low, the primary end point of most trials is complete response and/or recurrence rate after treatment.  Most of the identified studies were not of high quality and had short follow-up periods, which will lead to overestimations of tumor control; only one study had a follow-up period of as long as 4 years.  A literature review of recurrence rates in case series with long-term follow-up after treatment of BCCs indicated that only 50% of recurrences occurred within the first 2 years, 66% after 3 years, and 18% after 5 years.<Reference refidx="11"/>  A common finding was that the 10-year recurrence rates were about double the 2-year recurrence rates.  </Para><SummarySection id="_348"><Title>Treatment of Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin (Localized Disease)</Title><Para id="_412">Treatment options for BCC of the skin (localized disease) include:</Para><OrderedList id="_349" Style="Arabic"><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062909#_350" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-treatment-pdq">Surgical excision with margin evaluation</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062909#_354" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-treatment-pdq">Mohs micrographic surgery</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062909#_356" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-treatment-pdq">Radiation therapy</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem> <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062909#_360" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-treatment-pdq">Curettage and electrodesiccation</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062909#_363" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-treatment-pdq">Cryosurgery</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062909#_369" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-treatment-pdq">Photodynamic therapy</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062909#_374" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-treatment-pdq">Topical fluorouracil (5-FU)</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062909#_376" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-treatment-pdq">Imiquimod topical therapy</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062909#_379" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-treatment-pdq">Carbon dioxide laser</SummaryRef>.</ListItem></OrderedList><SummarySection id="_350"><Title>Surgical excision with margin evaluation</Title><Para id="_351">A traditional surgical treatment, surgical excision with margin evaluation usually relies on surgical margins ranging from 3 mm to 10 mm, depending on the diameter of the tumor.
