The endocrine disorders observed in MEN2 are medullary thyroid cancer (MTC); its precursor, C-cell
hyperplasia (CCH) (referred to as C-cell neoplasia or C-cell carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> in more recent publications)<Reference refidx="1"/>; pheochromocytoma (PHEO); and parathyroid adenomas and/or hyperplasia.
MEN2-associated MTC is often bilateral and/or multifocal and arises in the background of CCH. In contrast, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339347" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">sporadic</GlossaryTermRef> MTC is typically unilateral and/or unifocal. Because approximately 75% to 80% of sporadic cases also have associated CCH, this histopathologic feature cannot be used as a predictor of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460148" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">familial</GlossaryTermRef> disease.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Metastatic spread of MTC to regional lymph nodes (i.e.,
perithyroidal, paratracheal, jugular chain, and upper mediastinum) or to distant
sites, such as the liver, is common in patients who
present with a palpable thyroid mass or diarrhea.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  When thyroidectomy is performed before local nodal metastases occur, distant metastases are rare.<Reference refidx="5"/> Metastatic PHEOs have not been reported in individuals with MEN2.<Reference refidx="6"/> In MEN2, parathyroid
abnormalities  can range from benign parathyroid adenomas or multigland hyperplasia to clinically evident
hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia and renal stones.
</Para><Para id="_1157">The understanding of MEN2's natural history continues to evolve. Clinical observations suggest that the natural history of MEN2 (particularly the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339344" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">penetrance</GlossaryTermRef> of MTC) is variable. The manifestations of MEN2 could be subject to modifying effects from specific <GeneName>RET</GeneName> pathogenic variants, other genes, behavioral factors, or environmental exposures.<Reference refidx="7"/> For example, it is widely reported that most patients with MEN2 will develop MTC. A seminal study from 1989 (published before  the <GeneName>RET</GeneName> gene was discovered) found that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046171" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">screening</GlossaryTermRef> at-risk family members for MTC with pentagastrin stimulation  increased penetrance of MTC to 93%.<Reference refidx="8"/> In contrast, penetrance ranged from 41% to 65% when it was solely based on MTC clinical presentation.<Reference refidx="9"/> This difference suggests that individuals with MEN2 have MTC with varying  natural history, penetrance, and aggressiveness. As  research continues, the understanding of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000660739" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">genotype</GlossaryTermRef>-<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460203" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">phenotype</GlossaryTermRef> correlations and  recommendations for the optimal age for thyroidectomy continue to change.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_1024">MEN2   can be divided into two subtypes: <SummaryRef href="CDR0000813377#_1055" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/men2-hp-pdq">multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A</SummaryRef> (MEN2A) and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000813377#_1069" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/men2-hp-pdq">multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B</SummaryRef> (MEN2B). <SummaryRef href="CDR0000813377#_1067" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/men2-hp-pdq">Familial medullary thyroid cancer</SummaryRef> (FMTC) is generally considered to be  part of MEN2A, although it was historically thought  to be a separate   MEN2 subtype.</Para><Para id="_1026">Current stratification has moved away from a solely phenotype-based classification to one that is based on genotype (i.e., the pathogenic variant) and phenotype.<Reference refidx="11"/> The MEN2A syndrome is further classified on the basis of the presence of associated conditions.  For example, classical MEN2A includes those with MTC,  PHEO, and/or hyperparathyroidism.  Additional categories include MEN2A with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000763035" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">cutaneous lichen amyloidosis</GlossaryTermRef>, MEN2A with Hirschsprung disease, and FMTC (presence of a <GeneName>RET</GeneName> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000781852" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">germline pathogenic variant</GlossaryTermRef> and MTC but no family history of PHEO or hyperparathyroidism).<Reference refidx="1"/> Classifying a patient or family by MEN2 subtype is useful in

This shift is especially relevant for endocrine glands that are difficult to manage postresection and may require replacement therapy.

During follow-up, no patient experienced a hypertensive crisis or other problems attributable to an undiagnosed PHEO.

For adult patients with MEN2A, in whom the glands have been inadvertently devascularized during primary surgical treatment for MTC, it is suggested that the glands needing reimplantation be implanted in the nondominant forearm.
