Conducted from 2004 to 2008, a multicountry trial randomly assigned 4,065 boys and men to receive either the three-shot quadrivalent HPV vaccine regimen (for HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18) or a three-shot placebo injection regimen. Of the 4,065 patients, 602 reported having sex with male partners in the year before enrollment. Heterosexual participants were between the ages of 16 years and 23 years and had no more than five lifetime female partners. Patients who  reported sex with male partners were between the ages of 16 years and 26 years and had no more than five lifetime male or female partners. Persistent infection was defined as detection of the same HPV type in anogenital swabs or biopsy specimens collected on two or more consecutive visits, with an interval of 6 months between visits. In the intent-to-treat analysis, which included participants regardless of their baseline HPV status, the efficacy against persistent HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 infection was 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.0%–57.6%).

The study purported to show reduced mortality after an anal cancer diagnosis among screened men, but the curves in the study's results did not make adjustments for lead-time bias, selection bias, nor the possibility of overdiagnosis bias.   The study also suggested that there was a larger proportion of early-stage cases among screened individuals, but the proportional stage shift caused by anal cancer screening is known to be influenced by lead-time and overdiagnosis biases.  There was no mention of adjustment for these biases in the study's results. In addition, there was a high proportion of unknown stages, further suggesting that the conclusions in this study were not supported by the data.
