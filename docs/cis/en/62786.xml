Primary tumor response was measured after induction chemotherapy in three ways: as 30% or greater reduction in the longest dimension, 50% or greater reduction in tumor volume, or 65% or greater reduction in tumor volume (calculated from three tumor dimensions, a conventional radiological technique). The measurements were performed at diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy before primary tumor resection. None of the methods of measuring primary tumor response at end of induction chemotherapy predicted survival.<Reference refidx="117"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2050"><Title>Levels of LDH and ferritin</Title><Para id="_2051">Higher serum LDH and ferritin values conferred worse 5-year EFS and OS rates in a large international cohort of patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma (n &gt; 8,575) from 1990 to 2016.

For example, in the  case of spinal cord compression, an IDRF is present when more than one-third of the spinal canal in the axial plane is invaded, when the leptomeningeal spaces are not visible, or when the spinal cord magnetic resonance signal intensity is abnormal.

The primary tumor in INSS stage 4S must be INSS stage 1 or 2, while the primary tumor in MS can be L1 or L2, which includes INSS stages 1, 2, or 3.

The clinical effectiveness of one such antibody led to the FDA approval of dinutuximab. The patient's response to immunotherapy may be caused, in part, by variation in immune function among patients. One  anti-GD2 antibody, termed 3F8, used for treating neuroblastoma exclusively at one institution, directs natural killer  cells to kill the neuroblastoma cells. However, the natural killer cells can be inhibited by the interaction of HLA antigens and killer immunoglobulin receptor (KIR) subtypes.<Reference refidx="53"/><Reference refidx="54"/>  This finding was confirmed and expanded by an analysis of outcomes for patients treated in the national randomized <ProtocolRef nct_id="NCT00026312">COG-ANBL0032 (NCT00026312)</ProtocolRef> study with the anti-GD2 antibody dinutuximab combined with GM-CSF and IL-2.
