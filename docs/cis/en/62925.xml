portion and stratified columnar epithelium to stratified squamous epithelium in
the bulbous and penile portions.  The submucosa of the urethra contains
numerous glands.  Therefore, urethral cancer in men can manifest the
histological characteristics of transitional cell carcinoma, squamous cell
carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma.

common, squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histology of urethral
neoplasms.  Because transitional cell carcinoma of the prostatic urethra may be associated with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and/or
transitional cell carcinoma arising in prostatic ducts, it is often treated similarly to these primaries and should be separated from
the more distal carcinomas of the urethra.
