In a population-based registry linkage study of all live births in Texas from 1999 to 2017, children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome were 42 times more likely to develop pediatric cancer.

The two ICRs are characterized by differential methylation of maternal and paternal alleles.  A variety of molecular mechanisms are implicated in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome pathogenesis, leading to unbalanced expression of imprinted genes within these two domains. Tumor predisposition results primarily from dysregulation at the telomeric domain of 11p15 (ICR1 gain of methylation [ICR1-GoM] and paternal uniparental disomy [UPD]) rather than at the centromeric domain of 11p15 (ICR2 loss of methylation [ICR2-LoM] and <GeneName>CDKN1C</GeneName> variant).<Reference refidx="27"/> Approximately 15% of cases with clear-cut phenotypes have no molecular defects established so far.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_1251"> The molecular subtypes of the syndrome predispose patients to the development of different tumor histotypes.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/> </Para><Para id="_1180">The prevalence of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome has previously been reported as 1% of children with Wilms tumor.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/> However, a 5-year national Dutch cohort study demonstrated that 16% of patients with Wilms tumor (20 of 126) have Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

However, this incidence varies based on epigenotype. Children with ICR1-GoM have the highest risk of developing Wilms tumor (22%–29%).

The miRNA processing pathway is commonly mutated in Wilms tumor. Expression of mature miRNA is initiated by RNA polymerase–mediated transcription of DNA-encoded sequences into pri-miRNA, which form a long double-stranded hairpin. This structure is then cleaved by a complex of Drosha and DGCR8 into a smaller pre-miRNA hairpin, which is exported from the nucleus and then cleaved by Dicer (an RNase) and TRBP (with specificity for dsRNA) to remove the hairpin loop and leave two single-stranded miRNAs. The functional strand binds to Argonaute (Ago2) proteins into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where it guides the complex to its target mRNA, while the nonfunctional strand is degraded. Targeting of mRNAs by this method results in mRNA silencing by mRNA cleavage, translational repression, or deadenylation. Let-7 miRNAs are a family of miRNAs highly expressed in ESCs with tumor suppressor properties. In cases in which LIN28 is overexpressed, LIN28 binds to pre-Let-7 miRNA, preventing DICER from binding and resulting in LIN28-activated polyuridylation by TUT4 or TUT7, causing reciprocal DIS3L2-mediated degradation of Let-7 pre-miRNAs. Genes involved in miRNA processing that have been associated with Wilms tumor are highlighted in blue (inactivating) and green (activating) and include DROSHA, DGCR8, XPO5 (encoding exportin-5), DICER1, TARBP2, DIS3L2, and LIN28.
