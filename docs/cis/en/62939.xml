These aggressive neoplasms can arise virtually anywhere, but the site of origin is typically
in the midline (mediastinum, retroperitoneum, or pineal
gland).  Gonadal origin should be excluded by careful testicular examination
and ultrasound.  The diagnosis can be difficult and should be considered in any
patient with a poorly defined epithelial malignancy, particularly young
individuals with midline masses.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>
</Para><Para id="_12">An international germ cell tumor prognostic classification has been developed
based on a retrospective analysis of 5,202 patients with metastatic
nonseminomatous germ cell tumors and 660 patients with metastatic seminomatous germ cell
tumors.<Reference refidx="4"/>  All patients received treatment with cisplatin-containing or carboplatin-containing therapy as their first chemotherapy course.  The prognostic
classification, shown below, was agreed on in early 1997 by all major clinical
trial groups worldwide and  should be used for the reporting of clinical trial
results of patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors.
