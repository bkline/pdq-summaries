The progression from advanced cancer to death is experienced in different ways by different people. Most people will experience common or normal grief and will, with time, adjust to the loss; others will experience more severe grief reactions such as prolonged or complicated grief and will benefit from treatment. Some may even find that the cancer experience, although it is difficult and trying, may lead to significant personal growth for the patient and others in the patient’s family and social network.</Para><Para id="_151">Multiple factors may influence how an individual or a social network adjusts to a death. How people grieve depends on the personality of the grieving individual and his or her relationship with the person who died.

impending loss.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Anticipatory grief is  becoming increasingly recognized as an issue that can heighten distress for both patients and their social networks. The term <Strong>anticipatory grief</Strong> is most often used when discussing the families
of dying persons, although dying individuals themselves can experience
anticipatory grief.  Anticipatory grief  includes many of the same symptoms
of grief after a loss.  Anticipatory grief has been defined as “the total set
of cognitive, affective, cultural, and social reactions to expected death felt
by the patient and family.”<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_169">  Anticipatory grief has been empirically associated with escalated distress, pain, and medical complications.<Reference refidx="10"/>  When anticipatory grief needs are met, individuals are less likely to experience these negative outcomes at the end of life.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_274" Style="bullet"><ListItem><Strong>Fallacy #1: Anticipatory grief affects everyone.</Strong> Anticipatory grief cannot be assumed to be present merely because a warning of life-threatening illness has been given or because sufficient time has elapsed from the onset of illness until death. Approximately 25% of patients with incurable cancer experience anticipatory grief.<Reference refidx="10"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Fallacy #2: Anticipatory grief is the same as conventional grief, just starting earlier.</Strong> A major misconception is that anticipatory grief is merely conventional (postdeath) grief that begins earlier. There is not a fixed volume of grief to be experienced, implying that the amount of grief experienced in anticipation of the loss will decrease the remaining grief that will need to be experienced after the death.<Reference refidx="12"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Fallacy #3: Only a patient’s family members can experience anticipatory grief; the patient experiences depression.</Strong> While these domains may overlap, they have distinctly separate properties for both patients and members of their social networks. Anticipatory grief and depression can be assessed and treated as separate mental health issues by using measures specifically developed for anticipatory grief.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="13"/></ListItem><ListItem><Emphasis/><Strong>Fallacy #4: Different types of grief  can be treated the same.</Strong> Clinical data from several studies <Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/> showed that grief
following an unanticipated death differs from anticipatory grief.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Fallacy #5: We cannot predict who is likely to experience anticipatory grief.</Strong> A number of risk factors and protective factors relative to anticipatory grief have been identified.  Anticipatory grief is more likely to occur among individuals with dependent relationships, limited external social support, or even discomfort with close relationships.  People with lower levels of education, those with neuroticism, or those undergoing a spiritual crisis are also more likely to be at risk of developing anticipatory grief.<Reference refidx="16"/>

However, anticipatory grief is less likely to occur when the death is accepted by the patient and the patient’s social network.  When death acceptance rates are higher, there is decreased anxiety, depression, and anticipatory grief.<Reference refidx="17"/>
 Therefore, assessment for risk and treatment, as needed, using psychotherapy to address death acceptance may be useful to patients and their social networks.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_330">One study reported that parents who felt prepared for their child’s end of life had improved social functioning in the first 2 years of their bereavement.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_182"><Title>Normal or Common Grief</Title><Para id="_183">In general, normal or common grief reactions are marked by a gradual movement toward an acceptance of the loss and, although daily functioning can be very difficult, managing to continue with basic daily activities. Normal or common grief appears to occur in 50% to 85% of persons after they have experienced a loss.<Reference refidx="19"/> Normal grief usually includes some common emotional reactions that include emotional numbness, shock, disbelief, and/or denial often occurring immediately after the death, particularly if the death is unexpected. Much emotional distress is focused on the anxiety of separation from the loved one, which often results in yearning, searching, preoccupation with the loved one, and frequent intrusive images of death.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_184">Such distress can be accompanied by:<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_310" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Crying.</ListItem><ListItem>Sighing.</ListItem><ListItem>Having dreams, illusions, and even hallucinations of the deceased.</ListItem><ListItem>Seeking out things or places associated with the deceased.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_311">Some bereaved people will experience anger, protest the reality of the loss, and have significant periods of the following:<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_312" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Sadness.</ListItem><ListItem>Despair.</ListItem><ListItem>Insomnia.</ListItem><ListItem>Anorexia.</ListItem><ListItem>Fatigue.</ListItem><ListItem>Guilt.</ListItem><ListItem>Loss of interest.</ListItem><ListItem>Disorganization in daily routine.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_185">Many bereaved persons will experience highly intense, time-limited periods (e.g., 20–30 minutes) of distress, variously called grief bursts, pangs, or waves. Sometimes these pangs are reactions to reminders of the deceased, such as major cultural or social holidays, the anniversary of the patient’s death, or giving away items that belonged to the individual.  However, at other times, the pangs may occur unexpectedly.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_186">Over time, most bereaved people will experience symptoms less frequently, with briefer duration, or with less intensity. Although there is no clear agreement on any specific time period  needed for recovery, most bereaved persons experiencing normal grief will note a lessening of symptoms after about 6 months. However, there may be a significant difference between the expression of grief and the experience of grief.  Time lines related to the expression of grief:</Para><ItemizedList id="_313" Style="bullet"><ListItem>May be socially, religiously, or culturally influenced (e.g., wearing mourning clothes, sitting shiva, or lowering a flag).</ListItem><ListItem> Are time-limited.</ListItem><ListItem>Begin soon after a loss.</ListItem><ListItem>Largely resolve within 1 or 2 years.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_187"><Title>Models of Normal Grief</Title><Para id="_188">A number of theoretically derived models of normal grief have been proposed.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/> Most models hypothesize a normal grief process differentiated from various types of complicated grief. Some models have organized grief-related symptoms into phases or stages, suggesting that grief is a process marked by a series of phases with predominant characteristics. The most well-known model was developed for medical student education and used a series of clinical interviews with terminally ill patients.<Reference refidx="24"/> In this model, the five stages of grief were identified as denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. However, this model has limited empirical support.<Reference refidx="25"/> After initial development, the model was reconceptualized from <Emphasis>stages</Emphasis> of grief to <Emphasis>domains</Emphasis> of grief, with the understanding that an individual may move back and forth among the domains without any expectation of a predefined path or progression that is implied by the term <Emphasis>stages.</Emphasis><Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_275">In a 2-year study of the  stage theory of grief, results suggested that a more common pathway is disbelief, yearning, anger, depression, and acceptance, and that these negative psychosocial issues peak at approximately 6 months postloss.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_189">An adapted stage model of normal grief <Reference refidx="2"/> organizes psychological responses into four stages:<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_314" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Numbness-disbelief.</ListItem><ListItem>Separation distress (yearning-anger-anxiety).</ListItem><ListItem>Depression-mourning.</ListItem><ListItem> Recovery.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_315">Although presented as a stage model, this model explains “it is important to emphasize that the idea that grief unfolds inexorably in regular phases is an oversimplification of the highly complex personal waxing and waning of the emotional process.”<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_276">Another theory proposes the following four stages:<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_277" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Shock-numbness.</ListItem><ListItem>Yearning-searching.</ListItem><ListItem>Disorganization-despair.</ListItem><ListItem>Reorganization.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_278">Bereavement researchers have found empirical support for this four-stage model,<Reference refidx="5"/> with particular emphasis on the timing of grief.  Primary grief indicators peak at approximately 6 months postloss, after which the negative grief indicators begin to decline. This suggests that individuals who are still experiencing elevated levels of grief after that time may benefit from an escalated response from mental and physical health care providers.</Para><Para id="_279">Other researchers have conceptualized grief as tasks rather than stages. One investigator identified four tasks of mourning that help an individual continue to feel in control of his or her world, despite the destabilization that occurs with a loss.<Reference refidx="30"/> Also outlined are six mediators that influence how well someone is able to complete the tasks. These tasks include the following:<Reference refidx="31"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_316" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Accepting the reality of the loss.</ListItem><ListItem>Processing the pain of grief.</ListItem><ListItem>Adjusting to the world without the deceased.</ListItem><ListItem>Finding an enduring connection with the deceased while continuing to engage in new relationships.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_317"> In this model, the tasks may occur in any order without a fixed progression; however, for successful mourning to occur, the person must be able to achieve all four tasks.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_280"><Title>Differentiating Normal Grief Reaction From Major Depressive Disorder</Title><Para id="_281">There is a significant overlap between the behavioral manifestations associated with the grieving process and symptoms of depression such as insomnia, feelings of guilt, ruminations, and lack of motivation.  The fourth revised edition of the <Emphasis>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</Emphasis> (DSM-IV-TR) advised clinicians to refrain from diagnosing major depression in individuals within the first 2 months following the death of a loved one in what was referred to as the “bereavement exclusion.” The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) eliminated the bereavement exclusion in the diagnosis of major depression.<Reference refidx="32"/> This change was added to recognize that in vulnerable individuals, grief can precipitate major depression within a short time and can be potentially lethal.</Para><Para id="_282">DSM-5 carefully outlines the features of a normal grieving process as compared with a major depressive episode, as follows:<Reference refidx="32"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_283" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>In grief, painful feelings come in waves, lessen in intensity and frequency over time, and are often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased; in depression, mood and ideation are constantly negative.</ListItem><ListItem>In grief, the prevailing affect is one of emptiness; in major depression, it is a long, sustained, depressed mood and an inability to expect pleasure or happiness.</ListItem><ListItem>In grief, self-esteem is usually preserved; in major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.</ListItem><ListItem>In grief, while symptoms such as suicidal ideation can occur, they are generally focused on the deceased, such as a wish to join the deceased in death or feelings of guilt toward certain gaps or failures in the relationship with the deceased. In major depression, suicidal ideation is more likely directed at self only.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_284">DSM-5 emphasizes that although depression is a normal consequence of bereavement, major depression should not be diagnosed in the context of a normal grieving process. It also emphasizes that major depression can and should be diagnosed when symptoms and features of depression are present and clearly distinguishable from a normal grieving process. DSM-5 also created a candidate disorder, <Strong>persistent complex bereavement disorder,</Strong> recognizing the presence of a prolonged and complicated grief reaction in vulnerable individuals.<Reference refidx="32"/> This complicated grief reaction is recognized in the <Emphasis>International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 11th Revision</Emphasis> (<ExternalRef xref="https://icd.who.int/">ICD-11</ExternalRef>), as  <Strong>prolonged grief disorder.</Strong></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_190"><Title>Patterns of Complicated Grief</Title><Para id="_191">Many authors throughout history have proposed various patterns of normal grief compared with pathologic or complicated grief.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> Some proposed patterns come from extensive clinical observation <Reference refidx="33"/> supported by various theories (e.g., personality traits associated with patterns of attachment).<Reference refidx="34"/></Para><Para id="_192">These patterns are described in comparison with normal grief and highlight deviations from the normal patterns. Authors have developed a wide variety of theories and descriptive labels for abnormal grief patterns, but these labels have very limited empirical validity:</Para><ItemizedList id="_193" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Inhibited or absent grief: A pattern in which persons show little evidence of the expected separation distress, seeking, yearning, or other characteristics of normal grief.</ListItem><ListItem>Delayed grief: A pattern in which symptoms of distress, seeking, yearning, etc., occur at a much later time than is typical.</ListItem><ListItem>Chronic grief: A pattern emphasizing prolonged duration of grief symptoms.</ListItem><ListItem>Distorted grief: A pattern characterized by extremely intense or atypical symptoms.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_194">Empirical reviews have not found evidence of inhibited, absent, or delayed grief and instead emphasize the possibility that these patterns are better explained as forms of human resilience and strength.<Reference refidx="6"/> Evidence supports the existence of a minimal grief reaction—a pattern in which persons experience no, or only a few, signs of overt distress or disruption in functioning. This minimal reaction is thought to occur in approximately 15% of persons during the first 1 or 2 years after a loss.<Reference refidx="6"/> This minimal reaction may be particularly apparent in  someone who has  a mixed relationship with the deceased, or in someone who has intellectual disabilities or emotional expression difficulties, such as autism spectrum disorder.<Reference refidx="35"/> An observed minimal grief reaction should be interpreted with caution because the expression of grief may not adequately reflect the internal experience of grief.</Para><Para id="_195">Empirical support also exists for chronic or complicated grief, a pattern of responding in which persons experience symptoms of common grief but do so for a much longer time than the typical 1 or 2 years. Chronic or complicated grief is thought to occur in about 15% to 30% of bereaved persons.<Reference refidx="6"/> It may look very much like major depression, generalized anxiety, and possibly post-traumatic stress. However, these terms have fallen out of favor in the treatment community, replaced by the updated and more specific diagnostic criteria of DSM-5 (persistent complex bereavement disorder) and ICD-11 (prolonged grief disorder).<Reference refidx="36"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_197"><Title>Prolonged, Persistent, or Complex Grief</Title><Para id="_198">DSM-5 and ICD-11 include bereavement as a diagnosable code:</Para><ItemizedList id="_318" Style="bullet">

The remission rates for the four groups were as follows: nortriptyline alone, 56%; placebo alone, 45%; nortriptyline plus IPT, 69%; placebo plus IPT, 29%. Nortriptyline was superior to placebo in achieving remission (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .03).<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_261">The combination of nortriptyline with IPT was associated with the highest remission rate and highest rate of treatment completion. The study did not show a difference between IPT and placebo, possibly owing to specific aspects of the study design, including short duration of IPT (mean no. of days, 49.5) and small sample size.<Reference refidx="20"/> The high remission rate with placebo was another important limitation of the study. Consistent with previous open-label studies and for all four groups, improvement in grief intensity was less than improvement in depressive symptoms.</Para><Para id="_301">Another randomized controlled study (N = 395) enrolled patients with complicated grief and investigated the antidepressant citalopram and complicated grief treatment (CGT) to treat grief intensity and comorbid depression symptoms.<Reference refidx="21"/> Four treatment groups were compared: citalopram alone (n = 101), placebo alone (n = 99), citalopram with CGT (n = 99), and CGT with placebo (n = 96). All participants received pharmacotherapy following a specific protocol, and participants in the CGT groups received manual-based CGT in 16 concurrent weekly sessions. The primary outcome measure was a complicated grief–anchored Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. Depressive symptomatology was measured using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self-Report (QIDS-SR) questionnaire.</Para><Para id="_302">Grief-intensity responses for the four groups were as follows: placebo alone, 54.8%; citalopram alone, 69.3%; CGT plus placebo, 82.5%; and citalopram plus CGT, 83.7%. Participants’ response in the CGT-plus-placebo group was substantially better than that in the placebo-alone group (82.5% vs. 54.8%), showing the efficacy of CGT as a treatment for complicated grief. The addition of citalopram to CGT did not significantly improve grief outcomes (citalopram plus CGT vs. CGT plus placebo, 83.7% vs. 82.5%). However, the addition of citalopram  to CGT led to a significant decrease in comorbid depression symptoms compared to the CGT-plus-placebo group. Notably, adding CGT to citalopram substantially improved grief-intensity outcomes (citalopram plus CGT vs. citalopram alone, 83.7% vs. 69.3%), suggesting the importance of CGT as the primary treatment for the complicated grief process.<Reference refidx="21"/></Para><Para id="_262">In summary, the antidepressant studies conducted to date suggest that combining antidepressant treatment with grief-directed therapy is necessary, especially for patients struggling with complicated grief with comorbid depressive symptomatology. Antidepressants alone have a limited impact on grief intensity but are critical to reduce depressive symptomatology. Combining antidepressants with grief-directed therapy improves both depression symptoms and grief intensity.</Para></SummarySection><Table id="_263"><Title>Table 2.

were expected to be modeled as such.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Today there is a greater 
awareness of developmental differences between childhood and other developmental stages
in the human life cycle.  Differences between the grieving
process for children and the grieving process for adults are recognized.  It is now believed that the real issue
for grieving children is not whether they grieve, but how they exhibit their
grief and mourning.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_55">The primary difference between bereaved adults and bereaved children is that intense
emotional and behavioral expressions are not continuous in children.  A child’s
grief may appear more intermittent and briefer than that of an adult; in
fact, a child’s grief usually lasts longer.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_175">The work of mourning in childhood  needs to be addressed
repeatedly  at different developmental and chronological milestones.  Because
bereavement is a process that continues over time, children will revisit the
loss repeatedly, especially during significant life events (e.g., going to
camp, graduating from school, marrying, and experiencing the births of their own children). 
Children must complete the grieving process, eventually achieving resolution of grief.</Para><Para id="_56">Although the experience of loss is unique and highly individualized, several factors can
influence a child’s grief:<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_176" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Age.</ListItem><ListItem>Personality.</ListItem><ListItem>Stage

their feelings as openly as adults do.  In addition to verbal communication, grieving children may employ play, drama, art,
school work, and stories.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Bereaved children may not withdraw into
preoccupation with thoughts of the deceased person; they often immerse
themselves in activities (e.g., they may be sad one minute and then playing
outside with friends the next).  Families often incorrectly interpret this
behavior to mean the child does not really understand or has already gotten
over the death.  Neither assumption may be true; children’s minds protect them from
thoughts and feelings that are too powerful for them to handle.</Para><Para id="_177">Grief
reactions are intermittent because children cannot explore all of their
thoughts and feelings as rationally as adults can.  Additionally, children often have
difficulty articulating their feelings about grief.  A grieving child’s
behavior may speak louder than any words he or she could speak.  Strong
feelings of anger and fear of abandonment or death may be evident in the
behaviors of grieving children.  Children often play death games as a way of
working out their feelings and anxieties in a relatively safe setting.  These
games are familiar to the children and provide safe opportunities to express
their feelings.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><SummarySection id="_58"><Title>Grief and Developmental Stages</Title><Para id="_59">A child’s understanding of death and the events surrounding it  depends on the child’s

some limited way.  They do not fully separate death from life and may believe that the deceased continues to live (for instance, in the ground
where he or she was buried),  and they often ask questions about the activities of
the deceased person (e.g., how is the deceased eating, going to the toilet,
breathing, or playing?).  Young children can acknowledge physical death but
consider it a temporary or gradual event, reversible and not final
(like leaving and returning, or a game of peek-a-boo).  A child’s concept of
death may involve magical thinking, i.e., the idea that his or her thoughts can
cause actions.  Children may feel that they must have done or thought something
bad to cause a loved one to become ill or that a loved one’s death occurred because of the child’s personal
thought or wish.  In response to death, children younger than 5 years will
often exhibit disturbances in eating, sleeping, and bladder or bowel
control.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_66"><Title>Ages 6 to 9 years</Title><Para id="_67">It is not unusual for children in this age range to become very curious about death,
asking very concrete questions about what happens to one’s body when it stops
working.  Death is personified as a separate person or spirit: a skeleton,
ghost, angel of death, or bogeyman.  Although death is perceived as final and
frightening, it is not universal.  Children in this age range begin to compromise,
recognizing that death is final and real but mostly happens to older people (not
to themselves).  Grieving children can:</Para><ItemizedList id="_327" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Develop school phobias, learning
problems, and antisocial or aggressive behaviors.</ListItem><ListItem>Exhibit hypochondriacal
concerns.</ListItem><ListItem>Withdraw from others.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_328"> Conversely, children in this age range can
become overly attentive and clinging.  Boys may show an increase in
aggressive and destructive behavior (e.g., acting out in school), expressing
their feelings in this way rather than by openly displaying sadness.  When a
parent dies, children may feel abandoned by both their deceased parent and their
surviving parent because the surviving parent is frequently preoccupied with his or
her own grief and is less able to emotionally support the child.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_68"><Title>Ages 9 years and older</Title><Para id="_69">By the time a child is 9 years old, death is understood as inevitable and is

their own responses.  It is not uncommon for children to repeatedly ask
baffling questions.  For example, a child may ask, “I know Grandpa died, but
when will he come home?”  This is thought to be a way of testing reality for
the child and confirming the story of the death.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_73"><Title>Issues for grieving children</Title><Para id="_119">There are three prominent themes in the grief expressions of bereaved children:</Para><OrderedList id="_120" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Did I cause the death to happen?</ListItem><ListItem>Is it going to happen to me?</ListItem><ListItem>Who is going to take care of me?<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="7"/></ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_75"><Strong><Emphasis>Did I cause the death to happen?</Emphasis></Strong></Para><Para id="_76">Children often engage in magical thinking, believing they have magical powers.

children deal with loss.  When death is discussed with a child, explanations
should be kept as simple and direct as possible.  Each child needs to be told
the truth with as much detail as can be comprehended at his or her age and
stage of development.  Questions should be addressed honestly and directly. 
Children need to be reassured about their own security (they frequently worry
that they will also die or that their surviving parent will go away). 
A child’s questions should be answered, and the child’s processing of
the information should be confirmed.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_85"><Title>Correct language</Title><Para id="_86">Although initiating this conversation with children is difficult, any
discussion about death must include proper words (e.g., cancer, died, or death).  Euphemisms (e.g., “he passed away,” “he is sleeping,” or “we lost him”)

misinterpretations.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="8"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_87"><Title>Planning rituals</Title><Para id="_88">After a death occurs, children can and should be included in the planning of and
participation in mourning rituals.  As with bereaved adults, these rituals help
children  memorialize loved ones.  Although children should never be forced
to attend or participate in mourning rituals, their participation should be
encouraged.  Children can be encouraged to participate in aspects of
the funeral or memorial service with which they feel comfortable.  If the child
wants to attend the funeral (or wake or memorial service), it is important that
a full explanation of what to expect is given in advance.  This preparation
should include the layout of the room, who might be present (e.g., friends and
family members), what the child will see (e.g., a casket and people crying), and
what will happen.  Surviving parents may be too involved in their own
grief to give their children the attention they need. Therefore, it is often helpful
to identify a familiar adult friend or family member who will be assigned to
care for a grieving child during a funeral.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">O'Toole D, Cory J: Helping Children Grieve and Grow: a Guide for Those Who Care.
