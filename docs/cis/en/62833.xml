with an estimated 313,780 new cases and 35,770 deaths expected in 2025.<Reference refidx="1"/>   A wide range of
estimates of the impact of the disease are notable.  The disease is
histologically evident in as many as 34% of men in their fifth decade and in up
to 70% of men aged  80 years  and older.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer for U.S. men is 12.8%, while the lifetime risk of dying from prostate cancer is 2.0%.<Reference refidx="4"/> The estimated reduction in life
expectancy of men who die of prostate cancer is approximately 9 years.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_12">The extraordinarily high rate of clinically occult prostate cancer in the
general population compared with  the 20-fold lower likelihood of death from the
disease indicates that many of these cancers have low biological risk. Concordant
with this observation are the many series of patients with lower-risk (i.e., Gleason grade 6 and some low-volume Gleason grade 7 tumors)  prostate cancer
managed by surveillance alone with high survival rates at 5 and 10
years of follow-up.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Data demonstrate, however, that with longer follow-up, higher-grade cancers are associated with a greater risk of prostate cancer death.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>
</Para><Para id="_143">Because of marked variability in tumor differentiation from one microscopic field to another, many pathologists will report the range of differentiation among the malignant cells that are present in a biopsy using the Gleason grading system.  This grading system includes five histological patterns distinguished by the glandular architecture of the cancer. The architectural patterns are identified and assigned a grade from 1 to 5 with  1 being the most differentiated and 5 being the least differentiated. The sum of the grades of the predominant and next most prevalent  will range from 2 (well-differentiated tumors) to 10 (undifferentiated tumors).<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/>  Systematic changes to the histological interpretation of biopsy specimens by anatomical pathologists have occurred during the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening era (i.e., since about 1985) in the United States.<Reference refidx="11"/> This phenomenon, sometimes called grade inflation,      is the apparent increase in the distribution of high-grade tumors in the population for a period of time but in the absence of a true biological or clinical change. It is possibly the result of an increasing tendency for pathologists to read tumor grade as more aggressive,  resulting in a higher preponderance to treat these cancers aggressively.<Reference refidx="12"/> In general, these changes in interpretation have resulted in almost all prostate cancers being graded with Gleason grades of 3, 4, or 5; Gleason grades of 1 or 2 are highly unusual.</Para><Para id="_13">Treatment options available for prostate cancer include radical prostatectomy,
external-beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryotherapy, focal ablation, androgen  deprivation with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs and/or antiandrogens, intermittent androgen deprivation, cytotoxic agents,  and watchful waiting.  Of all the means of management, only radical prostatectomy has been tested in a randomized clinical trial to assess survival benefit.  In this study, prostatectomy was found  to be superior to surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer, diagnosed in an era before widespread PSA screening.        There were reduced rates of prostate cancer mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41–0.77) and overall mortality (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59–0.86).<Reference refidx="13"/> Only 12% of the men had nonpalpable T1x tumors, suggesting that a minority of tumors were detected by PSA screening, whereas the majority were clinically detected. The relative efficacy of radical prostatectomy compared with other forms of treatment has not been adequately addressed.<Reference refidx="14"/>  Previous studies that compared radical prostatectomy with radiation therapy and brachytherapy closed because of poor patient accrual. Confounding issues in the treatment of prostate cancer include side
effects of treatment, inability to predict the natural history of a given
cancer, patient comorbidity that may affect an individual’s likelihood of
surviving long enough to be at risk of disease morbidity and mortality, and an increasing body of evidence suggesting that, with careful  PSA monitoring following treatment, a
substantial fraction of patients may suffer disease recurrence.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_14">Because of considerable uncertainty regarding the efficacy of treatment and the
difficulty with selecting patients for whom there is a known risk of disease
progression,  opinion in the medical community is divided regarding
screening for carcinoma of the prostate.  While both digital rectal examination
and PSA screening have demonstrated reasonable performance characteristics (sensitivity,
specificity, and positive predictive value) for the early detection of prostate
cancer, conflicting outcomes of randomized trials examining the impact of screening on mortality has led some organizations to recommend for and others to recommend against screening.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_15">The tremendous impact of prostate cancer on the U.S. population and the
financial burden of the disease for both  patients and society have led to an
increased interest in primary disease prevention.</Para><Para id="_307">The main treatment modalities for prostate cancer are surgery, radiation, hormonal, and active surveillance.

by the fetal testis.  Testosterone causes normal virilization of the Wolffian
duct structures and internal genitalia and is acted upon by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase (5AR) to form DHT.  DHT has a 4-fold to 50-fold greater affinity for the androgen receptor than testosterone, and it is
DHT that leads to normal prostatic development.  Children born with abnormal
5AR (due to a change in a single base pair in exon 5 of the normal type II 5AR
gene), are born with ambiguous genitalia (variously described as hypospadias
with a blind-ending vagina to a small phallus) but masculinize at puberty because of the surge of testosterone production at that time.  Clinical, imaging, and
histological studies of kindreds born with 5AR deficiency have demonstrated a
small, pancake-appearing prostate with an undetectable prostate-specific

dietary fat and half found no association.<Reference refidx="34"/>  Among case-control studies,
 about half of the studies found an increased risk with increasing
dietary fat, animal fat, and saturated and monounsaturated fat intake while
approximately half found no association.  Only in studies of polyunsaturated
fat intake were  three studies reported  of a significant negative association
between prostate cancer and fat intake.  Fat of animal origin seems
to be associated with the highest risk.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="35"/>  In a series of 384 patients
with prostate cancer, the risk of cancer progression to an advanced stage was
greater in men with a high fat intake.<Reference refidx="36"/>  The announcement in 1996 that
cancer mortality rates had fallen in the United States prompted the  suggestion
that this may be caused by  decreases in dietary fat intake during the same time

</Para><Para id="_266">Two studies were conducted within the PCPT in which prospective nutritional information was collected and all participants were recommended to undergo biopsy.  Findings included that among 9,559 participants, there was no association between any supplement or nutrient (including fat) and risk of prostate cancer overall, but the risk of high-grade cancer was associated with high intake of polyunsaturated fats.   In a subset of 1,658 cases and 1,803 controls, specific fatty acids were examined, and docosahexaenoic acid was associated with risk of high-grade disease while <Emphasis>trans</Emphasis>-fatty acids (TFA) 18:1 and TFA 18:2 were inversely associated with risk of high-grade disease.  These large-scale studies suggest a complex relationship between nutrients such as fat and risk of prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/></Para><Para id="_35">The explanation for this possible association between prostate cancer and
dietary fat is unknown.  Several hypotheses have been advanced, including the following:
</Para><OrderedList id="_77" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Dietary fat may increase serum androgen levels, thereby increasing          
prostate cancer risk.  This hypothesis is supported by observations         
from South Africa and the United States that changes in dietary fat         
intake change urinary and serum levels of androgens.<Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="42"/></ListItem><ListItem>Certain types of fatty acids or their metabolites may initiate or           
promote prostate carcinoma development.  The evidence for this              
hypothesis is conflicting, but one study suggests that linoleic acid        
(omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid) may stimulate prostate cancer          
cells, while omega-3 fatty acids inhibit cell growth.<Reference refidx="43"/></ListItem><ListItem>An observation made in an animal model is that male offspring of            
pregnant rats who are fed a high-fat diet will develop prostate cancer at a         
higher rate than animals who are fed a low-fat diet.<Reference refidx="44"/>  This observation may      
explain some of the variations in prostate cancer incidence and

At 7 years, the incidence of prostate cancer was 18.4% in the finasteride group versus 24.4% in  the placebo group, a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 24.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.6%–30.6%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001).

While a gradual and progressive increase in the number of high-grade tumors would have been expected over the study duration of  7 years, when compared with placebo, this was not the case. The increase in high-grade tumors was seen within 1 year of finasteride exposure and did not increase during this time period.<Reference refidx="2"/> An analysis of the PCPT data adjusted for the sources of detection bias found that finasteride reduced the incidence of Gleason score 5 to 7 and Gleason score 3 to 4 prostate cancer, but not Gleason score 2 to 3 or Gleason score 8 to 10.

The 25% reduction in risk of prostate cancer death with finasteride was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, finasteride vs. placebo, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.50–1.12).    It was concluded that the early concern for an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer with finasteride was not borne out.

     <ListItem>A 39% improvement in prostate cancer mortality with a 2-year earlier diagnosis and with only 5.9 years of follow-up is implausible, given that the very best reduction in prostate cancer mortality in a randomized clinical trial was 20%.</ListItem><ListItem>Because the study could not assess 5-ARI medication adherence, PSA misadjustment was a serious concern.</ListItem><ListItem>Because men treated with 5-ARIs are very different than those not treated (i.e., more urinary symptoms, older, larger prostates, etc.), major differences in baseline characteristics, as reported in the study, prevented adequate adjustment in outcomes.</ListItem><ListItem>As demonstrated by the PCPT, because finasteride (a 5-ARI) prevents a substantial proportion of low-grade tumors, a greater proportion of high-grade tumors would be expected.</ListItem><ListItem>Because national treatment guidelines recommend 5-ARIs for men with larger prostates, which have higher PSA values, and as prostate cancers are more commonly missed in larger prostates (and may be identified at a subsequent biopsy, often with a magnetic resonance imaging-directed biopsy), a later diagnosis would be common in this patient population.</ListItem><ListItem>The authors' analysis did not adjust for survival bias; men not receiving a 5-ARI had an earlier diagnosis, and therefore, an inherent longer survival.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_309">When taken together, these biases call into question the conclusions, which appear to be at odds with the prostate cancer–specific mortality outcomes of the randomized PCPT.</Para><Para id="_230">The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE)  trial randomly assigned 8,231 men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk of prostate cancer (i.e., PSA 2.5–10.0 ng/mL) with one recent negative prostate biopsy to dutasteride at 0.5 mg daily or to placebo. The primary end point was prostate cancer diagnosed by prostate biopsy at 2 years and 4 years after randomization. After 4 years, among the 6,729 men (82% of initial population) who had at least one prostate biopsy, 25.1% of the placebo group and 19.9% of the dutasteride group had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, a statistically significant difference (absolute risk reduction, 5.1% and RRR, 22.8% [95% CI, 15.2%–29.8%]). The RRR in years 3 to 4 was similar to the RRR in years 1 to 2. The difference between the groups was entirely due to a reduction in prostate cancers with Gleason score 5 to 7.       For years 3 to 4 there was  a statistically significant increase in the dutasteride group compared with the placebo group in prostate cancers with Gleason score 8 to 10 (12 cancers in the dutasteride group vs. 1 cancer in the placebo group).<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_258">Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in high-grade tumors for Gleason score 8 to 10 cancers in years 1 to 4  (29 tumors in the dutasteride group vs. 19 tumors in the placebo group, 0.9% vs. 0.6%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .15). However, in a retrospective analysis there was a statistically significant difference between years 3 to 4. Because this is a small retrospective subgroup, the finding of an increase in Gleason score 8 to 10 cancers is of uncertain validity. However, the finding of no reduction in these cancers is more significant.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_231">While long-term data are unavailable for dutasteride as a cancer prevention agent, evidence is now available that finasteride does not have a significant effect on overall survival or prostate cancer–specific survival.  Its effect is primarily in preventing the diagnosis of prostate cancer and the subsequent events (staging, treatment, follow-up, and management of treatment-related side effects) after diagnosis.</Para><Para id="_111">Agents that are used
for hormonal therapy of existing prostate cancers would be unsuitable for
prostate cancer chemoprevention because of the cost and wide variety of side
effects including sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis, and vasomotor symptoms (hot
flushes).<Reference refidx="11"/>   Newer antiandrogens may play a role
as preventive agents in the future.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_265">A Cochrane systematic review of all published studies of clinical outcome investigations of the prostate preventive effects of 5-ARIs through 2010 that were at least 1 year in duration concluded that finasteride and dutasteride reduce the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer among men who are screened regularly for prostate cancer.  The review also concluded that mortality effects could not be assessed from these studies and that persistent use of these agents increased sexual and erectile dysfunction.  The review was based on MEDLINE and Cochrane Collaboration Library computerized searches through June 2010 using the Medical Subject Headings terms and text words <Strong>finasteride</Strong>, <Strong>dutasteride</Strong>, <Strong>neoplasms</Strong>, <Strong>azasteroids</Strong>, <Strong>reductase inhibitors</Strong>, and <Strong>enzyme inhibitors</Strong> to identify randomized trials.  Eight studies met the inclusion criteria.  Only the PCPT and the REDUCE study were designed to assess the impact of 5-ARIs on prostate cancer period prevalence.  Reviews of all eight studies concluded that compared with placebo, 5-ARIs resulted in 25% RR reduction in prostate cancers detected <Strong>for cause</Strong> (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67–0.83 and 1.4% absolute risk reduction [3.5% vs. 4.9%]).  Six trials of 5-ARIs versus placebo assessed prostate cancers detected overall.  Among these there was a 26% RR reduction favoring 5-ARIs (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55–1.00 and 2.9%  absolute risk reduction [6.3% vs. 9.2%]).  There were reductions across age, race, and family history.  One placebo-controlled trial of men considered at greater risk for prostate cancer based on age, elevated PSA, and previous suspicion of prostate cancer leading to a prostate biopsy reported that dutasteride did not reduce prostate cancers detected <Emphasis>for cause</Emphasis> based on needle biopsy but did reduce risk of overall incident prostate cancer detected by biopsy by 23% (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.7–0.85 and absolute risk reduction, 16.1% vs. 20.8%).  There were reductions across age, family history of prostate cancer, PSA level, and prostate volume subgroups.

A study evaluated 1,619
prostate cancer cases and 1,618 controls in a multicenter, multiethnic

cruciferous vegetables was associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer.</Para><Para id="_129">The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition examined the association between fruit and vegetable intake and subsequent prostate cancer.

While this outcome is unknown,
multiple additional benefits may be observed in patients following such a diet, including a lower
risk of hyperlipidemia, better control of blood pressure, and a lower risk of
cardiovascular disease—all of which may merit adoption of such a diet.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_53"><Title>Chemoprevention</Title><Para id="_54">While several agents, including alpha-tocopherol, selenium, lycopene,

have shown potential in either clinical or laboratory studies for
chemoprevention of prostate cancer. However, the correlations of cancer prevention with these agents are increasingly of concern given the statistically significant increased risk of prostate cancer with alpha-tocopherol in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) and the lack of preventive effect (actually, a nonsignificant increase in prostate cancer risk) with selenium.
</Para><SummarySection id="_218"><Title>Chemoprevention with selenium and vitamin E</Title><Para id="_222">The SELECT (NCT00006392) was a large randomized placebo-controlled trial of vitamin E and selenium. It showed no reduction in prostate cancer period prevalence, but an increased risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E alone.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_267">Compared with the placebo group in which 529 men developed prostate cancer, there was a statistically significant increase in prostate cancer in the vitamin E group (620 cases), but not in the selenium plus vitamin E group (555 cases) or in the selenium group (575 cases).  The magnitude of increase in prostate cancer risk with vitamin E alone was 17%.  Of interest, the statistically increased risk of prostate cancer among men receiving vitamin E was seen after study supplements had been discontinued suggesting a longer-term effect of this agent.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_72"><Title>Chemoprevention with lycopene</Title><Para id="_73">Evidence exists that a diet with a high intake of fruits and vegetables is
associated with a lower risk of cancer.  Which, if any, micronutrients may
account for this reduction is unknown.  One group of nutrients often postulated
as having chemoprevention properties is the carotenoids.  Lycopene is the
predominant circulating carotenoid in Americans and has a number of potential
activities, including an antioxidant effect.<Reference refidx="27"/>  It is encountered in a number
of vegetables, most notably tomatoes, and is best absorbed if these products
are cooked and in the presence of dietary fats or oils.
</Para><Para id="_74">The earliest studies of the association of lycopene and prostate cancer risk
were generally negative before 1995 with only one study of 180 case-control patients
showing a reduced risk.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/>  In 1995, an analysis of the Physicians’
Health Study found a one-third reduction in prostate cancer risk in the group
of men with the highest consumption of tomato products when compared with  the group
with the lowest level of consumption, which was attributed to the lycopene
content of these vegetables.<Reference refidx="32"/>  This large analysis prompted several
subsequent studies, the results of which were mixed.<Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/>  A review of the
published data concluded that the evidence is weak that lycopene is associated
with a reduced risk because previous studies were not controlled for total
vegetable intake (i.e., separating the effect of tomatoes from vegetables), dietary intake instruments are poorly able to quantify lycopene
intake, and other potential biases.<Reference refidx="35"/>  Specific dietary supplementation with
lycopene remains to be demonstrated to reduce prostate cancer risk. In the largest prospective study to date, the PCPT, lycopene was not associated with any reduction in risk of prostate cancer among 9,559 men studied.  Similarly, there was no relationship between lycopene serum concentrations and risk of prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="12824459" MedlineID="22750137">Thompson IM, Goodman PJ, Tangen CM, et al.: The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer.
