Initial risk classification systems used clinical factors such as age and presenting WBC count. Response-to-therapy measures were subsequently added, with some groups using early morphological bone marrow response (e.g., at day 8 or day 15) and with other groups using response of circulating leukemia cells to single-agent prednisone. Contemporary risk classification systems continue to use clinical factors such as age and presenting WBC count and incorporate cytogenetics and genomic lesions of leukemia cells at diagnosis (e.g., favorable and unfavorable translocations) and response to therapy based on detection of MRD at EOI (and in some cases at later time points).<Reference refidx="141"/> The risk classification systems of the COG and the BFM groups are briefly described below.</Para><SummarySection id="_605"><Title>Children’s Oncology Group (COG) risk groups </Title><Para id="_606">In COG protocols, children with ALL are initially stratified into treatment groups (with varying degrees of risk of treatment failure) on the basis of a subset of prognostic factors, including the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_624" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Age.</ListItem><ListItem>WBC count at

The two most important sanctuary sites in childhood ALL are the central nervous system (CNS) and the testes.

CNS-directed treatments include intrathecal chemotherapy, CNS-directed systemic chemotherapy, and cranial radiation. Some or all of these treatments are included in current regimens for ALL.

Clinical trials for children with ALL are generally designed to compare standard therapy for a particular risk group with a potentially better treatment approach that may improve survival and/or diminish toxicities associated with the standard treatment regimen. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Many of the therapeutic innovations that produced increased survival rates in children with ALL were achieved through clinical trials, and it is appropriate for children and adolescents with ALL to be offered participation in a clinical trial. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials">NCI website</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_1910">Risk-based treatment assignment is  an important therapeutic strategy  for
children with ALL.  This approach allows
children who historically have a very good outcome to be treated with less intensive therapy and to be
spared more toxic treatments, while children with a
historically lower probability of long-term survival receive more intensive
therapy that may increase their chance of cure. For more information about

Most patients tolerate the recommended doses of mercaptopurine with minimal side effects such as mild transaminitis and facial rashes. However, some patients experience more severe side effects, including liver toxicity, fasting hypoglycemia, abdominal pain, and fatigue. Mercaptopurine is metabolized to 6-thioguanine (6-TGN), which is responsible for its antileukemic effect, and also to 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides (6-MMP), which can be hepatotoxic. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase and blocks the conversion of mercaptopurine into 6-MMP via inhibition of TPMT. This results in increased production of 6-TGN and decreased 6-MMP. In several small, retrospective, single-center studies, the use of allopurinol in patients with ALL in maintenance decreased nonhematologic toxicity of mercaptopurine, especially hepatotoxicity and other GI-related side effects. Because an increase in 6-TGN metabolites is associated with myelosuppression, concurrent use of allopurinol with mercaptopurine typically requires a lower dose of mercaptopurine to avoid excessive neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.<Reference refidx="132"/><Reference refidx="133"/><Reference refidx="134"/><Reference refidx="135"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1106"><Title>Treatment options under clinical evaluation</Title><Para id="_1108">Risk-based treatment assignment is a key therapeutic strategy utilized for

Therefore, treatments with CD28-targeted CAR T cells are considered bridging therapies, and HSCT is generally planned for eligible patients 4 to 8 weeks after the CAR T-cell procedure.

Up to 80% of relapses occur during the first year after CAR T-cell therapy and there is a window of deep remission.
