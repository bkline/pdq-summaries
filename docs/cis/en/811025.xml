The most common symptom is blood in the urine, called hematuria. It’s often slightly rusty to bright red in color. You may see blood in your urine at one point, then not see it again for a while. Sometimes there are very small amounts of blood in the urine that can only be found by having a test done.</Para><Para id="_3">Other common symptoms of bladder cancer include</Para><ItemizedList id="_4" Style="bullet">

Keep in mind that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000800915" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">urinary tract infections</GlossaryTermRef>, kidney or bladder stones, or other problems related to the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046325" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">kidney</GlossaryTermRef> could be the cause, not cancer. Your doctor will ask you when your symptoms started and how often you’re having them. They will most likely ask you to give a urine sample as a first step in diagnosing what is causing your symptoms.
