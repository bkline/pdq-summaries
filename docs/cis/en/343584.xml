The group determined there was insufficient evidence to establish whether early CNS neoplasm detection results in reduced morbidity and/or mortality.

Shared decision-making between the medical provider and survivor is recommended to formulate a screening plan.<Reference refidx="68"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Screening for early-onset colorectal cancer:</Strong> Screening of those at risk of early-onset colorectal cancer (i.e., radiation doses of 20 Gy or higher to the abdomen, pelvis, or spine) includes colonoscopy every 5 years or multitarget stool DNA test every 3 years beginning at age 30 years or 5 years after radiation therapy (whichever occurs later).

This calculator may provide more individualized clinical heart failure risk estimation for 5-year survivors of childhood cancer who have recently completed therapy, through age 40 years.

Risk scores derived from a standard prediction model that included sex, chemotherapy exposure, and radiation therapy exposure identified statistically distinct low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk groups.

This finding was demonstrated by a CCSS investigation that constructed prediction models accounting for cardiotoxic cancer treatment exposures, combined with information on traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.  Risk scores based on demographic, cancer treatment, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes information showed good performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and concordance statistics ≥0.70) for predicting cardiovascular events in the models applied to the discovery and replication cohorts.

Also added text to state that the risk of KCs increased with higher radiation therapy doses. Per 10 Gy of radiation therapy at the KC site, the relative risk (RR) was similar for head/neck and extremity sites. The RR was slightly higher for trunk sites.
Allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) were associated with an increased risk of KCs.</Para><Para id="_3307">Revised <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584#_981" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">text</SummaryRef> to state that risk factors for malignant melanoma include radiation therapy higher than 40 Gy, alkylating agents, and bleomycin (cited Rotz et al. as reference 85).</Para><Para id="_3308">Added <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584#_2268" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">text</SummaryRef> about the results of a study that assessed the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes for patients with melanoma in the CCSS cohort.</Para><Para id="_3309"><Strong><SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584#_66" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">Late Effects of the Endocrine System</SummaryRef></Strong></Para><Para id="_3310">Added <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584#_1690" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">text</SummaryRef> about the results of a Dutch Childhood Cancer Survivors Study LATER 2 study that assessed the prevalence and determinants of metabolic syndrome in a cohort of 2,338 adult survivors of childhood cancer, compared with 132,226 adults without histories of cancer  from the Lifelines cohort (cited Bolier et al. as reference 102).</Para><Para id="_3311"><Strong><SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584#_92" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">Late Effects of the Musculoskeletal System</SummaryRef></Strong></Para><Para id="_3312">Added <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584#_1917" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">text</SummaryRef> about the results of a study that assessed bone mineral density deficits and associated risks factors in 3,919 5-year survivors in the St. Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE) cohort (cited Goodenough et al. as reference 35).</Para><Para id="_3313">Revised <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584#_2617" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">text</SummaryRef> to state that the most important treatment factor associated with the development of osteonecrosis is prolonged exposure to corticosteroids, which is typical in treatment regimens used for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and HSCT (cited Giertz et al. as reference 56).</Para><Para id="_3314"><Strong><SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584#_59" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">Late Effects of the Urinary System</SummaryRef></Strong></Para><Para id="_3315">Added <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584#_2682" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">text</SummaryRef> to state that adult survivors of unilateral, nonmetastatic, nonsyndromic Wilms tumor who were treated with whole-abdomen radiation therapy are at risk of impaired kidney function.
