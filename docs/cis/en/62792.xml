This procedure is called intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT), and it can be used in challenging cases where standard full-dose EBRT is contraindicated.

RT techniques may include external beam in fractionated or hypofractionated courses (e.g.,  stereotactic body radiation therapy, CyberKnife, or brachytherapy). The rationale is primarily to improve local control that can translate into a better quality of life. An impact on OS is unlikely because of the metastatic disease that often occurs. Even a benefit on local control is difficult to unequivocally demonstrate because of small patient numbers in available reports. For example, in a multi-institutional study of 23 patients with local relapse only (n = 19) or local relapse with distant failure (n = 4) who were managed with (n = 12) or without (n = 11) re-irradiation, the local failure-free survival and OS in re-irradiated versus unirradiated patients was 19.6 months versus 12.4 months (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .1) and 26.1 months  versus 18.8 months (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .46).
