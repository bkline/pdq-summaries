Ovarian carcinoma is a disease that predominantly affects postmenopausal women. Ovarian carcinomas consist of several histopathological types, with high-grade serous being both the most common and most lethal. The category of ovarian borderline tumor or tumor of low-malignant potential, which historically had been considered in the context of ovarian cancer, is now generally considered a nonmalignant entity, although it has a postulated relationship with the development of some histological subtypes of low-grade ovarian carcinomas.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_245">Risk factors for ovarian cancer include a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer and inheritance of deleterious mutations in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>, <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, and selected other high-penetrance genes.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062855" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq">Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers</SummaryRef>. Other risk factors for ovarian cancer include obesity, tall height, endometriosis, and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_246">Associations of some risk factors with ovarian cancer vary by histopathological subtype. The association of endometriosis with ovarian cancer is stronger for nonserous subtypes, especially clear cell carcinoma and endometrioid subtypes.<Reference refidx="10"/> Further, among carriers of deleterious mutations in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, increasing evidence suggests that many tumors previously classified as ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma may develop from malignant cells arising in the tubal epithelium (serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma [STIC]), although these tumors continue to be referred to as <Emphasis>ovarian</Emphasis> cancers in most writings. It is hypothesized that high-grade serous carcinomas among individuals who are not carriers of mutations in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> may also develop in the fallopian tube, but few STICs have been identified among these women in the absence of concurrent high-stage disease.   Further, data suggest that the distinction of high-grade serous carcinomas from other histological types of high-grade carcinomas, particularly endometrioid carcinomas, is not reliable. Reported rates of mucinous carcinoma diagnoses have declined dramatically, but expert pathology reviews suggest that this reflects increased recognition of metastases from occult gastrointestinal primary tumors to the ovary, rather than a true decline in rates of ovarian primary tumors.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Kurman RJ, Carcangiu ML, Young RH, eds.: WHO Classification of Tumours of Female Reproductive Organs. 4th ed.

These cancers usually present with symptomatic bulky stage III or IV disease and ascites. Many, but possibly not all, high-grade serous carcinomas appear to arise from malignant <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> lesions in the epithelium of the fallopian tube fimbria. These lesions spread to the ovaries secondarily but continue to be referred to as ovarian carcinomas. Evidence for a tubal origin is based mainly on examination of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy specimens, performed among <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers, in which incidental low-volume disease enables recognition of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC). However, not all women with high-grade serous carcinomas have identifiable STIC, and few studies of the fallopian tubes of women who are not carriers of <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutations have been performed, suggesting that pathogenesis of these tumors is not fully known. Serous carcinomas can be further divided on the basis of molecular characteristics.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_140">The heterogeneity in the etiology and pathogenesis of different ovarian cancer subtypes and variability in the classification of tumors over time and between studies pose challenges for interpretation of etiological data.  Ovarian cancer is rare, thus sample size and power of studies to detect moderate associations by cancer subtype is limited.

The association is stronger with nonserous histological subtypes, specifically endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas. In one analysis, data were pooled from 13 ovarian cancer case-control studies, including 13,226 controls and 7,911 women with invasive ovarian cancer who were part of the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. Logistic regression analyses were undertaken to assess the association between self-reported endometriosis and risk of ovarian cancer. Self-reported endometriosis was associated with a significantly increased risk of clear cell (odds ratio [OR], 3.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.43–3.84; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001), low-grade serous (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.39–3.20; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001), and endometrioid invasive ovarian cancers (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.67–2.48; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001). No association was noted between endometriosis and risk of mucinous (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.69–1.50; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .93) or high-grade serous invasive ovarian cancer (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.97–1.32; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .13), or borderline tumors of either subtype (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.95–1.52; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .12 for serous and OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.84–1.48; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .45 for mucinous).<Reference refidx="1"/> Considering that the clear cell and endometrioid ovarian cancers represented approximately 15% of all ovarian cancers, the lifetime risk of these histological subtypes is approximately 0.2%, which, on the basis of these data, would increase to approximately 0.4% to 0.6% in the presence of self-reported endometriosis.</Para><Para id="_330">A cohort study from the Danish National Patient Register identified 45,790 women with a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis between 1977 and 2012.

Endometriosis was associated with modestly increased risks of ovarian cancer overall (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16–1.55). This was primarily caused by increases in endometrioid (SIR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.09–2.37) and clear cell subtypes (SIR, 3.64; 95% CI, 2.36–5.38). No increased risk of serous or mucinous histological subtypes was reported.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_331">Using data from the Nurses’ Health Study II, 228 ovarian cancers were identified from among 102,025 eligible women. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess associations between endometriosis and cancer risk, evaluating the impacts of self-reported versus laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis, delayed diagnosis, and postendometriosis diagnosis changes in risk-factor exposures. Self-reported endometriosis was associated with ovarian cancer (relative risk [RR], 1.81; 95% CI, 1.26–2.58), which was stronger for laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis diagnoses (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.45–3.15). Diagnosis delays or postendometriosis diagnosis changes in risk factors had little impact on risk. Although this study had limited power to detect differences in risk on the basis of histological subtype, nonserous cases were shown to have an increased risk (RR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.48–4.01), and serous cases were not (RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.92–3.11).<Reference refidx="3"/> A large case-control study in African American women found similar associations with a history of endometriosis and ovarian cancer (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.09–2.90), suggesting that findings from populations of predominantly White women are also observed in Black women.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_143"><Title>Hormone Replacement Therapy/Hormone Therapy</Title><Para id="_256">A meta-analysis of 52 studies (17 prospective and 35 retrospective) including 21,488 ovarian cancers found increased risks with current or recent hormone replacement use in prospective studies (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.29–1.46), with similar results for retrospective designs.

Summary statistics were not calculated because of methodological and clinical heterogeneity.   Among seven cohort studies that compared treated women with untreated subfertile women, no excess risk was noted in association with hyperstimulation medications.  Two cohorts noted an increased risk of twofold to fivefold when treated women were compared with the general population.  An increased risk of borderline ovarian tumors was noted in three case-control studies and two cohort studies.  Overall, the authors concluded there was no convincing evidence that an increased risk of invasive ovarian tumors was associated with fertility drug treatments.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_150">After the Cochrane review, a follow-up study of an infertility cohort <Reference refidx="3"/> was published.

Among the subgroup of women who remained nulligravid after treatment, an increased risk of ovarian cancer was associated with clomiphene citrate (RR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.36–9.72).
