Most  of the blood supply to the normal liver parenchyma comes from the portal vein, whereas blood flow to the tumor comes mainly from the hepatic artery. Furthermore, HCC tumors are generally hypervascular compared with the surrounding normal parenchyma. The obstruction of the arterial branch(es) feeding the tumor may reduce the blood flow to the tumor and result in tumor ischemia and necrosis. </Para><Para id="_104">Embolization agents, such as microspheres and particles, may also be administered along with concentrated doses of chemotherapeutic agents (generally doxorubicin or cisplatin) mixed with lipiodol or other emulsifying agents during chemoembolization, arterial chemoembolization (usually via percutaneous access), and TACE.

     <ListItem>The 5-year tumor-free survival rate was 57.9% for liver transplant, 49.3% for resection, and 10.6% for radiofrequency ablation. Subgroup analysis showed that transplant and resection led to comparable survival and that both treatments led to significantly better outcomes than did ablation (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001).
