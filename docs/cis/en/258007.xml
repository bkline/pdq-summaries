Between 2012 and 2021, the number of new colorectal cancer cases in the United States decreased. This decline was largely driven by falling rates in adults aged 65 and older, who continue to have the highest overall rates of colorectal cancer. The drop in older adults may be due in part to increased colorectal cancer screening, which can detect and remove precancerous growths before they develop into cancer. However, trends vary by age group. Among adults younger than 50, the number of new cases of colorectal cancer rose by about 2.4% per year, the largest increase among all age groups. In people aged 50 to 64, the number of new cases increased slightly per year.</Para><Para id="_188">Since 1970, the death rate from colorectal cancer has declined in men and women.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
