         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer 
         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower 
         the number of deaths caused by cancer.</Para><Para id="_2">To prevent new cancers from starting, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">scientists</GlossaryTermRef> look at <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045873" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">risk 
         factors</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000439422" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">protective factors</GlossaryTermRef>. Anything that increases your 
         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; 
         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is 
         called a cancer protective factor.</Para><Para id="_3">Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. 
         For example, both smoking and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045098" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">inheriting</GlossaryTermRef> certain <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">genes</GlossaryTermRef> are 
         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be 
         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">diet</GlossaryTermRef> may be protective 
         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and 
         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does 
         not mean that you will not get cancer. </Para><Para id="_50">Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_4"><Title>General Information About Endometrial Cancer</Title><SummarySection id="_5"><SectMetaData><SectionType>Organ description</SectionType><SectionType>Cancer description</SectionType></SectMetaData><KeyPoint id="_6">Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)
