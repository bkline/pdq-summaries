Angiosarcoma is a fast-growing cancer that forms in the blood vessels or lymph vessels in any part of the body, usually in the soft tissue. 
Most angiosarcomas are in the skin or in the soft tissue near the skin. Those in deeper soft tissue can form in the liver, spleen, and lung. This cancer is very rare in children. Children sometimes have more than one tumor in the skin, liver, or both.
Rarely, infantile hemangioma may become angiosarcoma.

The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
