For young people who weren’t vaccinated within the age recommendations, HPV vaccination is recommended up to age 26. Some adults between the ages of 27 and 45 who are not already vaccinated may decide to get the HPV vaccine after talking with their doctor about their risk of new HPV infections.</Para><Para id="_19">The HPV vaccine is given as a series of two or three doses, depending on age. CDC recommends that children who start the vaccine series before age 15 receive two doses. For people who receive the first dose on or after their 15th birthday, and for people with certain immunocompromising conditions, CDC recommends getting three doses. </Para><Para id="_31">Learn more about <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-vaccine-fact-sheet">HPV vaccines</ExternalRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_20"><Title>Cervical cancer screening</Title><Para id="_34">Because HPV vaccination doesn’t protect against all HPV types that can cause cervical cancer, getting screened at regular intervals is still important.</Para><Para id="_21">Two widely used screening tests are HPV tests and cytology tests (also known as Pap test or Pap smear). These tests can find high-risk HPV infections and abnormal cell changes and precancers that can be treated before they turn into cancer.
