However, recent estimates suggest that more than 10% of all hematologic malignancies (HM) may have an inherited component. The presentations of HHM syndromes occur on a spectrum. They can occur during childhood with conditions like inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, or they can occur in adulthood with conditions like <GeneName>DDX41</GeneName>-associated myeloid cancers, in which malignancy occurs at a median age of 68 years.  Updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HMs (i.e., the World Health Organization, International Consensus Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemias [ICC], and European LeukemiaNet [ELN] guidelines) now include genetic testing  considerations for HHM. Genetic testing for HHM is often  challenging because it can be difficult  to obtain a normal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460154" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">germline</GlossaryTermRef> control tissue sample,   such as a skin biopsy, to confirm the hereditary nature of a predisposing <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000783960" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">pathogenic variant</GlossaryTermRef>.  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a curative treatment for many HMs. However,  timely diagnosis of an HHM is essential for evaluation and management. Timely diagnosis allows for the identification of optimal  transplant donors who are related to the patient (i.e., family members who are HSCT matches but  do not have the same HHM), the selection of appropriate cytoreductive therapy, and the transplant conditioning regimen.  </Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="35767897">Arber DA, Orazi A, Hasserjian RP, et al.: International Consensus Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemias: integrating morphologic, clinical, and genomic data.

WES and WGS can also enable detection of LOH through bioinformatic algorithms.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_1384">The optimal genetic testing approach depends on the patient's clinical presentation and local genetic testing resources. WES and WGS are emerging as a standards since they can reanalyze data over time as new genetic associations are reported.
