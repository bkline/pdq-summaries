combinations of known and/or new agents to improve the
best available, accepted therapy.  Clinical trials in pediatrics are designed
to compare potentially better therapy with currently accepted
standard therapy.  This comparison may be done in a randomized study of two treatment
arms or by evaluating a single new treatment and comparing the results with
those previously obtained with standard therapy.
</Para><Para id="_36">All children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) should consider enrolling in a clinical trial.  Treatment planning by a multidisciplinary team of
cancer specialists with experience treating tumors of childhood is strongly
recommended to determine, coordinate, and implement treatment to achieve
optimal survival.  Children with NHL should be referred for treatment by a
multidisciplinary team of pediatric oncologists at an institution with
experience in treating pediatric cancers.  Information about ongoing National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical
trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials">NCI website</ExternalRef>.

A study by the Children’s Cancer Group demonstrated that the outcomes for patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma were superior with longer acute lymphoblastic leukemia–like therapy, while patients with nonlymphoblastic NHL (Burkitt lymphoma)  had superior outcomes with short, intensive, pulsed therapy.

Thus, cardiac or respiratory arrest is a significant risk, particularly if the patient is placed in  a supine position for procedures such as computed tomography (CT) or echocardiography scans.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Most of these procedures can be performed with patients on their side or prone. </Para><Para id="_742">Because of the risk of
complications from general anesthesia or heavy sedation, a careful physiological and radiographic
evaluation of the patient should be completed, and the least invasive
procedure should be used to establish the diagnosis of lymphoma.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/> The following procedures may be used:  </Para><ItemizedList id="_994" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.</ListItem><ListItem>Thoracentesis. If a pleural or pericardial effusion is present, a cytological diagnosis is
frequently possible using thoracentesis, with confirmation of the diagnosis and cell lineage by flow cytometry.</ListItem><ListItem>Lymph node biopsy. In children who present with
peripheral adenopathy, a lymph node biopsy performed under local anesthesia and with the patient in an
upright position may be possible.<Reference refidx="18"/>    </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_995">In situations when the above
procedures do not yield a diagnosis, the use of a CT-guided core-needle biopsy should be considered.  This procedure can frequently be performed using light sedation and local anesthesia before more
invasive procedures are undertaken.  Care should be taken to keep patients out of a supine position. Mediastinoscopy, anterior mediastinotomy, or thoracoscopy
are the procedures of choice when other diagnostic modalities fail to establish
the diagnosis.  A formal thoracotomy is rarely, if ever, indicated for the
diagnosis or treatment of childhood lymphoma.</Para><Para id="_743">Occasionally, it will not be
possible to perform a diagnostic operative procedure because of the risk of
complications from general anesthesia or heavy sedation.  In these situations, preoperative
treatment with steroids or, less commonly, localized radiation therapy should be considered. 
Because preoperative treatment may affect the ability to obtain an accurate
tissue diagnosis, a diagnostic biopsy should be done as soon as the risk of
complications from general anesthesia or heavy sedation is reduced.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_647"><Title>Tumor lysis syndrome</Title><Para id="_648">Tumor lysis syndrome results from rapid breakdown of malignant cells, causing several metabolic abnormalities, most notably hyperuricemia,
hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Patients may present with tumor lysis syndrome before the start of therapy.  </Para><Para id="_996">Hyperhydration and allopurinol or

these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity

trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy.  Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
