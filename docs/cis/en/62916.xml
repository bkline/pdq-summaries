The mean age-adjusted incidence of uveal melanoma in the United States is approximately 4.3 new cases per million people, with no clear variation by latitude.  The incidence is higher in men (4.9  cases per million) than in women (3.7 cases per million).<Reference refidx="1"/>  The age-adjusted incidence of this cancer has remained stable since at least the early 1970s.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  U.S. incidence rates are lower than the rates of other reporting countries, which vary from about 5.3 to 10.9 cases per million.  Some of the variation may be the result of  differences in inclusion criteria and methods of calculation.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_342">Uveal melanoma is most often diagnosed in older individuals, with a progressively rising, age-specific incidence rate that peaks near age 70 years.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_343"> Host susceptibility factors associated with the development of this cancer include:<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_344" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>White race and ethnicity.</ListItem><ListItem>Light eye color.</ListItem><ListItem>Fair skin.</ListItem><ListItem>The ability to tan.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_299"> In view of these susceptibility factors, numerous observational studies have explored the relationship between sunlight exposure and risk of uveal melanoma. These studies have found only weak associations or yielded contradictory results.<Reference refidx="3"/> Similarly, there is no consistent evidence that occupational exposure to  UV light or other agents is a risk factor for uveal melanoma.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_300"><Title>Anatomy</Title><Para id="_290">Uveal melanomas can arise in the anterior (iris) or the posterior (ciliary body or choroid) uveal tract.<Reference refidx="6"/> Most uveal tract melanomas originate in the choroid. The ciliary body is a less common site of origin, and the iris is the least common. The comparatively low incidence of iris melanomas has been attributed to the characteristic features of these tumors; they tend to be smaller, slower growing, and relatively dormant compared with their posterior counterparts. Iris melanomas rarely metastasize.<Reference refidx="7"/> Melanomas of the posterior uveal tract generally have a more malignant histological appearance; are detected later; and metastasize more frequently than iris melanomas. The typical choroidal melanoma is a brown, elevated, dome-shaped subretinal mass. The degree of pigmentation ranges from dark brown to totally amelanotic. </Para><Para id="_291">Most uveal melanomas are initially completely asymptomatic. As the tumor enlarges, it may cause distortion of the pupil (iris melanoma), blurred vision (ciliary body melanoma), or markedly decreased visual acuity caused by  secondary retinal detachment (choroidal melanoma). Serous detachment of the retina may occur. If extensive detachment occurs, secondary angle-closure glaucoma occasionally develops. Clinically, several lesions simulate uveal melanoma, including metastatic carcinoma, posterior scleritis, and benign tumors, such as nevi and hemangiomas.<Reference refidx="8"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000543553" type="image/jpeg" alt="Eye anatomy; two-panel drawing showing the outside and inside of the eye.
