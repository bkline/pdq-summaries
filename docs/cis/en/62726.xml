This study found that the omission of radiation therapy was possible in select patients without compromising oncologic outcomes based on a noninferiority study design.

Although the primary end point was sphincter preservation, late toxicity was not statistically significantly different between the two treatment approaches (7% for the long-course group vs. 10% for the short-course group). Of note, data on anal sphincter and sexual function were not reported, and toxicity was determined by the physician, not patient reported. </Para><Para id="_1382">The choice of long-course versus short-course radiation therapy for rectal cancer is an area of active study, and it is not known which is superior. Generally, long-course chemoradiation therapy results in a higher biologically equivalent dose being delivered to the patient (along with chemosensitization, most commonly with capecitabine or 5-FU), which would theoretically result in improved local control. This is supported by the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062726#_1365" url="/types/colorectal/hp/rectal-treatment-pdq">RAPIDO trial</SummaryRef>, where a higher local recurrence rate was seen in the patients who received short-course radiation therapy rather than those who received long-course chemoradiation therapy.<Reference refidx="35"/>  </Para><Para id="_1383">Alternatively, short-course radiation therapy requires a shorter break from stronger systemic therapy.  Therefore, if a patient is at a relatively higher risk of local recurrence than distant recurrence, long-course chemoradiation therapy may be preferred, but if the patient is at a higher risk of distant recurrence, short-course therapy may be preferred to allow a quicker return to chemotherapy. Many physicians also do not offer short-course chemoradiation therapy when a nonoperative management approach is used, as it has not been studied, and given the potentially lower local control rates due to the lower biologically equivalent dose as compared with long-course chemoradiation therapy. The optimal sequencing of radiation therapy and chemotherapy when given as a part of total neoadjuvant therapy is still being evaluated. There are also some clinical situations where short-course radiation therapy may not be preferred, such as when a rectal stent is present (which may result in greater rectal toxicity).</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1336"><Title>Capecitabine and fluorouracil dosing</Title><SummarySection id="_sm_CDR0000813769_3"><Para id="_sm_CDR0000813769_4">The <GeneName>DPYD</GeneName> gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil.
