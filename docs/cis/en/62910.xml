The rate of tumor growth varies from very slow to moderately rapid, and some patients may have prolonged survival even after the cancer has metastasized to distant sites, such as bone. The 5-year relative survival rate for men diagnosed in the United States from 2014 to 2020 with local or regional disease was greater than 99%, and  the rate for distant disease was 37%; a 97% survival rate was observed for all stages combined.<Reference refidx="2"/> The approach to treatment is influenced by age and coexisting medical problems. Side effects of various forms of treatment should be considered in selecting appropriate management.</Para><Para id="_2566">Many patients—especially those with localized tumors—may die of other illnesses without ever having suffered disability from prostate cancer, even if managed conservatively without an attempt at curative therapy.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  In part, these favorable outcomes are likely the result of  widespread screening  with the  prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, which can identify patients with  asymptomatic tumors that have little or no lethal potential.<Reference refidx="5"/> The prevalence of clinically indolent tumors is estimated at 30% to 70% in men older than  60 years, based on autopsy series of men dying of causes unrelated to prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_2086"> Because diagnostic methods have changed over time, any analysis of survival after treatment of prostate cancer and comparison of the various treatment strategies is complicated by evidence of increasing diagnosis of nonlethal tumors. Nonrandomized comparisons of treatments may be confounded not only by patient selection factors but also by time trends.</Para><Para id="_2087">For example, a population-based study in Sweden showed that, from 1960 to the late 1980s, before the use of PSA for screening purposes, long-term relative survival rates after the diagnosis of prostate cancer improved substantially as more sensitive methods of diagnosis were introduced. This occurred despite the use of watchful waiting or active surveillance or palliative hormonal treatment as the most common treatment strategies for localized prostate cancer during the entire era (&lt;150 radical prostatectomies per year were performed in Sweden during the late 1980s). The investigators estimated that, if all prostate cancers diagnosed between 1960 and 1964 were of the lethal variety, then at least 33% of cancers diagnosed between 1980 and 1984 were of the nonlethal variety.<Reference refidx="8"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000810035" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence C1</LOERef>]  With the advent of PSA screening as the most common method of detection in the United States, the ability to diagnose nonlethal prostate cancers has further increased.</Para><Para id="_2088">Another issue complicating comparisons of outcomes among nonconcurrent series of patients is the possibility of changes in criteria for the histological diagnosis of prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="9"/> This phenomenon creates a statistical artifact that can produce a false sense of therapeutic accomplishment and may also lead to more aggressive therapy. </Para><Para id="_2089">Controversy exists about the value of screening, the most appropriate staging evaluation, and the optimal treatment of each stage of the disease.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/></Para><SummarySection id="_1679"><Title>Incidence and Mortality</Title><Para id="_1680">Estimated new cases and deaths from prostate cancer in the United States in 2025:<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_1681" Style="bullet">

In the United States, most prostate cancers are diagnosed because of screening, either with a PSA blood test or, less frequently, with a  digital rectal examination. Randomized trials have yielded conflicting results.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>  Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses have reported no clear evidence that screening for  prostate cancer decreases the risk of death from prostate cancer, or that the  benefits outweigh the harms of screening.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_2092">For a detailed summary of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062755" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-screening-pdq">Prostate Cancer Screening</SummaryRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1686"><Title>Pathology </Title><Para id="_2567">More than 95% of primary prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas. Prostate adenocarcinomas are frequently multifocal and heterogeneous in patterns of differentiation.  Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) (noninvasive atypical epithelial cells within benign-appearing acini) is often present in association with prostatic adenocarcinoma. PIN is subdivided into low grade and high grade. The high-grade form may be a precursor of adenocarcinoma.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_1687">Several rare tumors account for the rest of the cases.

The classical score is derived by adding the two most prevalent pattern grades, yielding a score ranging from 2 to 10.  Because there is some evidence that the least-differentiated component of the specimen may provide independent prognostic information, the score is often provided by its separate components (e.g., Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7; or 4 + 3 = 7).<Reference refidx="22"/></Para><Para id="_2098">   There is evidence that, over time, pathologists have tended to award higher Gleason scores to the same histological patterns, a phenomenon sometimes termed <Strong>grade inflation</Strong>.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/>  This phenomenon complicates comparisons of outcomes in current versus historical patient series. For example, prostate biopsies from a population-based cohort of 1,858 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1990 through 1992 were re-read in 2002 to 2004.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/>  The contemporary Gleason score readings were an average of 0.85 points higher (95% confidence interval, 0.79–0.91; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001) than the same slides read a decade earlier.  As a result, Gleason-score standardized prostate cancer mortality rates for these men were artifactually improved from 2.08 to 1.50 deaths per 100-person years—a 28% decrease even though overall outcomes were unchanged.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2100"><Title>Molecular markers</Title><Para id="_2569">A number of tumor markers are associated with the outcome of patients with prostate cancer, including:<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_2570" Style="bullet">

Most urologists now perform a transrectal biopsy using a bioptic gun with ultrasound guidance.  Less frequently, a transperineal  ultrasound-guided approach can be used in patients who may be at increased risk of complications from a transrectal approach.<Reference refidx="25"/> Over the years, there has been a trend toward taking eight to ten or more biopsy samples from several areas of the prostate with a consequent increased yield of cancer detection after an elevated PSA blood test.<Reference refidx="21"/>  </Para><Para id="_3175">The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)−directed biopsy in the initial diagnostic evaluation of prostate cancer is also being studied, either as a replacement for, or in addition to, standard systematic prostate needle biopsies.  The data have been reported primarily by experienced MRI radiologists and urologists in referral centers, and generalizability of results is uncertain. A multicenter randomized trial of 500 patients has shown that, in experienced hands, a multiparametric MRI-directed biopsy is more accurate than a transrectal-guided biopsy to detect clinically significant cancers. MRI led to the detection of more Gleason score (≥7) lesions and fewer Gleason score (&lt;7) lesions, with fewer biopsies overall.<Reference refidx="26"/> The data suggested that MRI-directed biopsy can replace standard transrectal-guided biopsies.  However, a large, single-arm, single-center study of 2,103 men with MRI-visible lesions who underwent both MRI-directed biopsies and standard systematic prostate needle biopsies under ultrasound visualization suggested otherwise.<Reference refidx="27"/> In that study, MRI-directed biopsies alone led to misclassification of 8.8% of cancers defined as clinically significant (Gleason score 4 + 3 or higher) compared with the combination of both biopsy techniques.  Both studies reported only on histology end points at the time of diagnosis, rather than health outcomes on follow-up.</Para><Para id="_2103">Prophylactic antibiotics, especially fluoroquinolones, are often used before transrectal needle biopsies. There are reports of increasing rates of sepsis, particularly with fluoroquinolone-resistant <Emphasis>Escherichia coli</Emphasis>, and hospitalization after the procedure.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/>  Therefore, men undergoing transrectal biopsy should be told to seek medical attention immediately if they experience fever after biopsy.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_35"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_36">The following factors influence the survival of patients with prostate cancer:<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_37" Style="bullet"><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910#_38" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Extent of tumor</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910#_41" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Histological grade of tumor</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910#_45" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Patient's age and health</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910#_47" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level</SummaryRef>.</ListItem></ItemizedList><SummarySection id="_38"><Title>Extent of tumor </Title><Para id="_39">When the cancer is confined to the prostate gland, long-term prognosis is excellent.

cancer has spread to distant organs, current therapy will not cure it.  Median

Men should be interviewed and examined for symptoms or signs of recurrent or progressing disease, as well as side effects of therapy that can be managed by changes in therapy.  However, using surrogate end points for clinical decision-making is controversial, and the evidence that changing therapy based on such end points translates into clinical benefit is weak. Often, rates of PSA change are thought to be markers of tumor progression. However, even though a tumor marker or characteristic may be consistently associated with a high risk of prostate cancer progression or death, it may be a poor predictor and of limited utility in making therapeutic decisions. </Para><Para id="_2109">Although the PSA test is nearly universally used to follow patients, the diversity of recommendations on follow-up care reflects the lack of research evidence on which to base firm conclusions. A systematic review of international guidelines highlights the need for robust primary research to inform future evidence-based models of follow-up care for men with prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="53"/> </Para><Para id="_2110">Preliminary data from a retrospective cohort of 8,669 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with either radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy suggested that short posttreatment PSA doubling time (&lt;3 months in this study) fulfills some criteria as a surrogate end point for all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality after surgery or radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="54"/></Para><Para id="_2111">Likewise, a retrospective analysis (<ProtocolRef nct_id="NCT00004001">SWOG-S9916</ProtocolRef> [NCT00004001]) showed  PSA declines of 20% to 40% (but not 50%) at 3 months and 30% or more at 2 months after initiation of chemotherapy for hormone-independent prostate cancer, and  fulfilled several criteria of surrogacy for overall survival (OS).<Reference refidx="55"/></Para><Para id="_2112">These observations should be independently confirmed in prospective study designs and may not apply to patients treated with hormonal therapy.

Among these 315 men, 103 (34%) developed clinical evidence of recurrence.  The median time to the development of clinical metastasis after biochemical recurrence was 8 years.

The general concept of watchful waiting is patient follow-up with the application of palliative care as needed to alleviate symptoms of tumor progression.  There is no planned attempt at curative therapy at any point in follow-up.  For example, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or hormonal therapy may be used to alleviate tumor-related urethral obstruction should there be local tumor growth; hormonal therapy or bone radiation might be used to alleviate pain from metastases. Radical prostatectomy has been compared with watchful waiting or active surveillance/active monitoring in men with early-stage disease (i.e., clinical stages T1b, T1c, or T2).<Reference refidx="5"/>  For more information, see  the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910#_2281" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Radical Prostatectomy</SummaryRef> section.</Para><Para id="_2573">In contrast, the strategy behind active surveillance/active monitoring is to defer therapy for clinically localized disease but regularly follow the patient and initiate local therapy with curative intent if there are any signs of local tumor progression.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> The intention is to avoid the morbidity of therapy in men who have indolent or nonprogressive disease but preserve the ability to cure them should the tumor progress.
