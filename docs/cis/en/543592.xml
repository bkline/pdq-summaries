A report of the Dartmouth Atlas Project analyzed Medicare data from 2007 to 2010 for cancer patients older than 65 years who died within 1 year of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="2"/> Across the United States, 25% of patients died in a hospital, with 62% hospitalized at least once in the last month of life. In addition, 29% of patients were admitted to an intensive care unit in the last month of life. Approximately 6% of patients nationwide received chemotherapy in the last month of life. Conversely, about 61% of patients who died used hospice service. However, the average length of stay in hospice was only 9.1 days, and 11% of patients were enrolled in the last 3 days of life. Significant regional variations in the descriptors of end-of-life (EOL) care remain unexplained.</Para><Para id="_283">Patient and family preferences may contribute to the observed patterns of care at the EOL. Patient recall of EOL discussions, spiritual care, or early palliative care, however, are associated with less-aggressive EOL treatment and/or increased utilization of hospice.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> In addition, death in a hospital has been associated with poorer quality of life and increased risk of psychiatric illness among bereaved caregivers.<Reference refidx="8"/> Thus, it is important to help patients and their families articulate their goals of care and preferences near the EOL.

However, the available literature suggests that medical providers inaccurately predict how long patients will live and tend to overestimate survival times.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> This appears to hold true even for providers who are experienced in treating patients who are terminally ill. In a multicenter cohort study of 230 hospitalized patients with advanced cancer, palliative care providers correctly predicted time to death for  only 41% of patients. Survival time was overestimated in 85% of patients for whom medical providers gave inaccurate predictions, and providers were  particularly likely to overestimate survival for Black and Latino patients.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_521">Providers attempting to make prognostic determinations may attend to symptoms that may herald the EOL, or they may observe trends in patients’ functional status. For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592#_285" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">Impending Death</SummaryRef> section.</Para><Para id="_255">For example, one group of investigators <Reference refidx="5"/> retrospectively analyzed nearly 71,000 Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) scores obtained from a cohort of 11,374 adult outpatients with cancer who were assessed by physicians or nurses at the time of clinic visits.  The PPS is an 11-point scale describing a patient’s level of ambulation, level of activity, evidence of disease, ability to perform self-care, nutritional intake, and level of consciousness.</Para><Para id="_302">The investigators assigned patients to one of four states:</Para><ItemizedList id="_303" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Stable (PPS score, 70–100).</ListItem><ListItem> Transitional (PPS score, 40–60).</ListItem><ListItem>EOL (PPS score, 10–30).</ListItem><ListItem>Dead.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_304">Of the 4,806 patients who died during the study period, 49% were recorded as being in the transitional state, and 46% were recorded  as being in the stable state. For a patient who was in the transitional state, the probability of dying within a month  was 24.1%, which was less than that for a patient in the EOL state (73.5%). The results suggest that serial measurement of the PPS may aid patients and clinicians in identifying the approach of the EOL.</Para><Para id="_546">In contrast to the data indicating that clinicians are relatively poor independent prognosticators, a study published in 2019 compared the relative accuracies of the PPS, the Palliative Prognostic Index, and the Palliative Prognostic Score with clinicians' predictions of survival for patients with advanced cancer who were admitted to an inpatient palliative care unit. At study enrollment, the investigators calculated the scores from the three prognostication tools for 204 patients and asked the unit’s palliative care attending physician to estimate each patient’s life expectancy (0–14 days, 15–42 days, or over 42 days). Reasons for admission included pain (90.7%), bowel obstruction (48.0%), delirium (36.3%), dyspnea (34.8%), weakness (27.9%), and nausea (23.5%).<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_549">The study found that all four prognostic measures had similar levels of accuracy, except for clinician predictions of survival, which were more accurate for 7-day survival. The authors hypothesized that clinician predictions of survival may be comparable or superior to prognostication tools for patients with shorter prognoses (days to weeks of survival) and may become less accurate for patients who live for months or longer.<Reference refidx="6"/> However, clinician predictions of survival may have been unusually accurate in this study because of the evaluators’ subspecialty experience in palliative care and the more predictable environment and patient population of an acute palliative care unit.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_285"><Title>Impending Death</Title><Para id="_286"><Strong>Impending death,</Strong> or <Strong>actively dying,</Strong> refers to the process in which patients who are expected to die within 3 days exhibit a constellation of symptoms.<Reference refidx="7"/> In the final days of life, patients often experience progressive decline in their neurocognitive, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and muscular function, which is  characteristic of the dying process. A number of highly specific clinical signs can be used to help clinicians establish the diagnosis of impending death (i.e., death within days).<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_287">Impending death is a diagnostic issue rather than a prognostic phenomenon because it is an irreversible physiological process. The ability to diagnose impending death with confidence is of utmost importance to clinicians because it could affect their communication with patients and families and inform complex health care decisions such as:<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_525" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Hospital discharge.</ListItem><ListItem>Discontinuation of prescription medications.</ListItem><ListItem>Artificial nutrition.</ListItem><ListItem>Use of life support measures.</ListItem><ListItem>Enrollment on clinical care pathways.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_526"> Because clinicians often overestimate survival,<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> they often hesitate to diagnose impending death without adequate supporting evidence.</Para><Para id="_288">One study examined five signs in cancer patients recognized as actively dying.  Investigators reported that the median time to death from the onset of death rattle was 23 hours; from the onset of respiration with mandibular movement, 2.5 hours; from the onset of cyanosis in extremities, 1 hour; and from the onset of pulselessness on the radial artery, 2.6 hours.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_289">The Investigating the Process of Dying study systematically  examined physical signs in 357 consecutive cancer patients.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Among the ten target physical signs, there were three early signs and seven late signs.  The early signs had high frequency, occurred more than 1 week before death, and had moderate predictive value that a patient would die in 3 days. Early signs included the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_290" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Decreased level of consciousness (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score of –2 or lower).</ListItem><ListItem>Decreased performance status (PPS score ≤20%).</ListItem><ListItem>Dysphagia of liquids.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_291">The late signs occurred mostly in the last 3 days of life, had lower frequency, and were highly specific for impending death in 3 days. Late signs included the following:<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_341" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Pulselessness on the radial artery.</ListItem><ListItem>Respiration with mandibular movement.</ListItem><ListItem>Decreased urine output.</ListItem><ListItem>Cheyne-Stokes breathing.</ListItem><ListItem> Death rattle.</ListItem><ListItem>Apnea periods.</ListItem><ListItem>Peripheral cyanosis.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_294">In particular, the high positive likelihood ratios (LRs) of pulselessness on the radial artery (positive LR, 15.6), respiration with mandibular movement (positive LR, 10), decreased urine output (≤200 cc/d) (positive LR, 15.2), Cheyne-Stokes breathing (positive LR, 12.4), and death rattle (positive LR, 9) suggest that these physical signs can be  useful for the diagnosis of impending death.<Reference refidx="9"/> Because of low sensitivity, the absence of these signs cannot rule out impending death. A prospective observational study that examined vital signs in the last 7 days of life reported that blood pressure and oxygen saturation decreased as death approached. However, a large proportion of patients had normal vital signs, even in the last 12 hours of life. Moderate changes in vital signs from baseline could not definitively rule in or rule out impending death in 3 days.  Therefore, predicting death is difficult, even with careful and repeated observations.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_342">Several other late signs that have been found to be useful for the diagnosis of impending death include the following:<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_295" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem> Nonreactive pupils (positive LR, 16.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.9–18.6).</ListItem><ListItem>Decreased response to verbal stimuli (positive LR, 8.3; 95% CI, 7.7–9).</ListItem><ListItem>Decreased response to visual stimuli (positive LR, 6.7; 95% CI, 6.3–7.1).</ListItem><ListItem>Inability to close eyelids (positive LR, 13.6; 95% CI, 11.7–15.5).</ListItem><ListItem>Drooping of the nasolabial fold (positive LR, 8.3; 95% CI, 7.7–8.9).</ListItem><ListItem>Hyperextension of the neck (positive LR, 7.3; 95% CI, 6.7–8).</ListItem><ListItem> Grunting of vocal cords (positive LR, 11.8; 95% CI, 10.3–13.4).</ListItem><ListItem>Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (positive LR, 10.3; 95% CI, 9.5–11.1).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_296">In conclusion, bedside physical signs may be useful in helping clinicians diagnose impending death with greater confidence, which can, in turn, assist in clinical decision making and communication with families.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_297"><Title>Care During the Final Hours of Life</Title><Para id="_298">The recognition of impending death is also an opportunity to encourage family members to notify individuals close to the patient who may want an opportunity to “say goodbye.”  In the final hours of life, care should be directed toward the patient and the patient’s loved ones.  In addition to continuing a careful and thoughtful approach to any symptoms a patient is experiencing, preparing family and friends for a patient’s death is critical.  Preparations include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_305" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Acknowledging the symptoms that are likely to occur.</ListItem><ListItem>Articulating a plan to respond to the symptoms.</ListItem><ListItem>Eliciting fears or concerns of family members.</ListItem><ListItem>Assuring that respectfully allowing life to end is appropriate at this point in the patient’s life.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_566">For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592#_7" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">Symptoms During the Final Months, Weeks, and Days of Life</SummaryRef> section.</Para><Para id="_306">Encouraging family members who desire to “do something” to participate in the care of the patient (e.g., moistening the mouth) may be helpful. In the final days to hours of life, patients often have limited, transitory moments of lucidity.  Family members should be prepared for this and educated that this is a natural aspect of the dying process and not necessarily a result of medications being administered for symptoms or a sign that the patient is doing better than predicted. Despite their limited ability to interact, patients may be aware of the presence of others; thus, loved ones can be encouraged to speak to the patient as if he or she can hear them.</Para><Para id="_299">Educating family members about certain signs is critical. In the final hours of life, patients often experience a decreased desire to eat or drink, as evidenced by clenched teeth or turning from offered food and fluids. This behavior may be difficult for family members to accept because of the meaning of food in our society and the inference that the patient is “starving.” Family members should be advised that forcing food or fluids can lead to aspiration. Reframing will include teaching the family to provide ice chips or a moistened oral applicator to keep a patient’s mouth and lips moist. Finally, the death rattle is particularly distressing to family members. It is important to assure family members that death rattle is a natural phenomenon and to pay careful attention to repositioning the patient and explain why tracheal suctioning is not warranted.<Reference refidx="15"/> For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592#_363" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">Death Rattle</SummaryRef> section.</Para><Para id="_300">For patients who die in the hospital, clinicians need to be prepared to inquire about the family’s desire for an autopsy, offering reassurance that the body will be treated with respect and that open-casket services are still possible, if desired.</Para><Para id="_301">Health care professionals, preferably in consultation with a chaplain or religious leader designated by the patient and/or family,  need to explore with families any fears associated with the time of death and any cultural or religious rituals that may be important to them. Such rituals might include placement of the body (e.g., the head of the bed facing Mecca for an Islamic patient) or having only same-sex caregivers or family members wash the body (as practiced in many orthodox religions).  When death occurs, expressions of grief by those at the bedside vary greatly, dictated in part by culture and in part by their preparation for the death. Chaplains are to be consulted as early as possible if the family accepts this assistance. Health care providers can offer to assist families in contacting loved ones and making other arrangements, including contacting a funeral home.

However, when the results of published studies of symptoms experienced by patients with advanced cancer are being interpreted or compared, the following methodological issues need to be considered:<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_308" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Variation in the instrument used to assess symptoms and/or severity of symptoms.</ListItem><ListItem>Variation in the timing of symptom assessment and whether the assessments were repeated over time.</ListItem><ListItem>Population studied in terms of specific cancers, or a less specified population of people with cancer.</ListItem><ListItem>Whether patients were recruited in the outpatient or inpatient setting.</ListItem><ListItem>Whether specialized palliative care services were available.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_309">Results of one of the larger and more comprehensive studies of symptoms in ambulatory patients with advanced cancer have been reported.<Reference refidx="2"/> Ambulatory patients with advanced cancer were included in the study if they had completed at least one Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) in the 6 months before death.

ESAS anorexia, drowsiness, fatigue, poor well-being, and dyspnea increased in intensity closer to death. In contrast, ESAS depression decreased over time. Dysphagia of solids and liquids and urinary incontinence were also present in an increasing proportion of patients in the last few days of life.  Less common but equally troubling symptoms that may occur in the final hours include death rattle and hemorrhage.</Para><Para id="_311">The following sections summarize some of the common symptoms and potential approaches to ameliorating those symptoms, based on available evidence. A final note of caution is warranted. Symptoms often cluster, and the presence of a symptom should prompt consideration of other symptoms to avoid inadvertently worsening other symptoms in the cluster. For example, a systematic review of observational studies concluded that there were four common clusters of symptoms (anxiety-depression, nausea-vomiting, nausea-appetite loss, and fatigue-dyspnea-drowsiness-pain).<Reference refidx="4"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_180"><Title>Delirium</Title><Para id="_181">Terminal delirium occurs before death in 50% to 90% of patients.<Reference refidx="5"/> Most patients have hypoactive delirium, with a decreased level of consciousness. Agitation, hallucinations, and restlessness may occur in a small proportion of patients with hyperactive and/or mixed delirium. Delirium is associated with  shorter survival and complicates symptom assessment, communication, and decision making.

Rescue doses equivalent to the standing dose were allowed every 1 hour as needed and once at protocol initiation, with the goal of producing sedation with a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score of 0 to –2. Dose escalations and rescue doses were allowed for persistent symptoms.</Para><Para id="_537">Of the 68 randomized patients, 45 patients were treated and monitored until death or discharge. Patients in all three groups demonstrated clinically significant decreases in RASS scores within 30 minutes and remained sedated at 24 hours. No statistically significant difference in sedation levels was observed between the three protocols. However, the chlorpromazine group was less likely to develop breakthrough restlessness requiring rescue doses or baseline dosing increases. The most common adverse event was hypotension, which was seen in 40% of patients in the haloperidol group, 31% of those in the chlorpromazine group, and 21% of those in the combination group.<Reference refidx="17"/> One patient in the combination group discontinued therapy because of akathisia. The study was limited by a small sample size and the lack of a placebo group. Although all three interventions were effective at controlling agitation, it is worth noting that they controlled agitation via significant sedation, which may not be desired by all patients and/or their families.</Para><Para id="_425">Although benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam) or antidopaminergic medications could exacerbate delirium, they may be useful  for the treatment of hyperactive delirium that is not controlled by  other supportive measures. In intractable cases of delirium, palliative sedation may be warranted. A randomized controlled trial compared the effect of lorazepam versus placebo as an adjunctive to haloperidol on the intensity of agitation in 58 patients with delirium in a palliative care unit.<Reference refidx="18"/> Patients were eligible for the study if they had a diagnosis of delirium with a history of agitation (hyperactive delirium subtype).  Once enrolled, patients began a regimen of haloperidol 2 mg IV every 4 hours, with 2 mg IV hourly as needed for agitation.  The RASS score was monitored every 2 hours until the score was 2 or higher.  At this threshold, the patient received lorazepam 3 mg  or matching placebo with one additional dose of haloperidol 2 mg. The primary outcome of RASS score reduction was measured 8 hours after  administration of the study drug. Patients in the lorazepam group experienced a statistically significant reduction in RASS score (increased sedation) at 8 hours (–4.1 points for lorazepam/haloperidol vs. –2.3 points for placebo/haloperidol; mean difference, –1.9 points [95% confidence interval, –2.8 to –0.9]; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001). Lorazepam-treated patients also required significantly lower doses of rescue neuroleptics and, after receiving the study medication, were perceived to be in greater comfort  by caregivers and nurses. No differences in mortality were noted between the treatment arms.</Para><Para id="_432">Caution should be exercised in the use of this protocol because of the  increased risk of significant sedation.  The reduction in agitation is directly proportional to increased sedation to the point of patients being “minimally responsive to verbal stimulus” or conversion to hypoactive delirium  during the remaining hours of life.<Reference refidx="19"/> Communication with patients and surrogates to determine goal-concordant care in the setting of terminal or hyperactive delirium is imperative to ensure that sedation is an intended outcome of this protocol in which symptom reduction is the primary intention of the intervention. Intensive evaluation of RASS scores may be challenging for the bedside nurse.

Whether patients with less severe respiratory status would benefit is unknown. The generalizability of the intervention is limited by the availability of  equipment for noninvasive ventilation.

The treatment of troublesome coughing in patients in the final weeks to days of life is largely empiric, although diagnostic imaging or evaluation may occasionally be of value. In another study of patients with advanced cancer admitted to acute palliative care units, the prevalence of cough ranged from 10% to 30% in the last week of life.<Reference refidx="3"/> However, simple investigations such as reviewing medications or eliciting a history of symptoms compatible with gastroesophageal reflux disease are warranted because some drugs (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) cause cough, or a prescription for antacids may provide relief. In addition, patients may have comorbid conditions that contribute to coughing.

The authors also observed a nonsignificant association between treatment in community settings, as opposed to academic centers, and risk of receiving systemic treatments (either immunotherapy or chemotherapy) within 30 days of EOL.

An important strategy to achieve that goal is to avoid or reduce medical interventions of limited effectiveness and high burden to the patients. There is, however, a great deal of confusion, anxiety, and miscommunication around the question of whether to utilize potentially life-sustaining treatments (LSTs) such as mechanical ventilation, total parenteral nutrition, and dialysis in the final weeks or days of life.  To ensure that the best interests of the patient—as communicated by the patient, family, or surrogate decision maker—determine the decisions about LSTs, discussions can be organized around the following questions:</Para><ItemizedList id="_201" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>What are the patient’s goals of care?</ListItem><ListItem>How do the potential benefits of LST contribute to achieving the goals of care, and how likely is the desired outcome?</ListItem><ListItem>How do the potential harms of LST detract from the patient’s goals of care, and does the likelihood of achieving the desired outcome or the value the patient assigns to the outcome justify the risk of harm?</ListItem><ListItem>What considerations—other than the potential benefits and harms of LST—are relevant to the patient or surrogate decision maker?</ListItem><ListItem>What other resources—e.g., palliative care, a chaplain, or  a clinical ethicist—would help the patient or family with decisions about LST?</ListItem></ItemizedList><SummarySection id="_203"><Title>Ethical Perspectives</Title><Para id="_204">Medicine is a moral enterprise. The decisions clinicians make are often highly subjective and value laden but seem less so because, equally often, there is a shared sense of benefit, harm, and what is most highly valued. Occasionally, disagreements arise or a provider is uncertain about what is ethically permissible. For example, an oncologist may favor the discontinuation or avoidance of LST, given the lack of evidence of benefit or the possibility of harm—including increasing the suffering of the dying person by prolonging the dying process—or based on concerns that LST interferes with the patient accepting that life is ending and finding peace in the final days. A provider also may be uncertain about whether withdrawing treatment is equivalent to causing the patient’s death. Conversely, the patient may continue to request LST based on personal beliefs and a preference for potential prolonged life, independent of the oncologist’s clinical risk-benefit analysis.</Para><Para id="_327">Individual values inform the moral landscape of the practice of medicine. The potential conflicts described above are opportunities to refine clinicians’ understanding of their beliefs and values and to communicate their moral reasoning to each other as a sign of integrity and respect.<Reference refidx="1"/>  As clinicians struggle to communicate their reasons for recommendations or actions, the following three questions may serve as a framework:<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_273" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Who makes the decision?</ListItem><ListItem>By what criteria do they make the decision? </ListItem><ListItem>How are conflicts among decision makers resolved?</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_328">In the event of conflict, an ethics consult may be necessary to identify the sources of disagreement and potential solutions, although frameworks have been proposed to guide the clinician.<Reference refidx="3"/> The following paragraphs summarize information relevant to the first two questions.</Para><Para id="_329">Respect for patient autonomy is an essential element of the relationship between oncology clinician and patient. Respect for autonomy encourages clinicians to elicit patients’ values, goals of care, and preferences and then seek to provide treatment or care recommendations consistent with patient preferences.<Reference refidx="4"/> Autonomy is primarily a negative right to be free from the interference of others or, in health care, to refuse a recommended treatment or intervention.<Reference refidx="5"/> On the basis of potential harm to others or deliberate harm to themselves, there are limits to what patients can expect in terms of their requests. More controversial limits are imposed when oncology clinicians feel they are asked to violate their ethical integrity or when the medical effectiveness of a treatment does not justify the burden.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_330">Perceived conflicts about the issue of patient autonomy may be avoided by recalling that promoting patient autonomy is not only about treatments administered but also about discussions with the patient.<Reference refidx="4"/> It is acceptable for oncology clinicians to share the basis for their recommendations, including concerns such as clinician-perceived futility.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_331">The following criteria to consider forgoing a potential LST are not absolute and remain a topic of discussion and debate; however, they offer a frame of reference for deliberation:</Para><ItemizedList id="_332" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>The possibility of forgoing a potential LST is worth considering when either the clinician perceives that the medical effectiveness of an intervention is not justified by the medical risks, or the patient perceives that the benefit (a more subjective appraisal) is not consistent with the burden.</ListItem><ListItem>The goal of forgoing a potential LST is to relieve suffering as experienced by the patient and not to cause the death of the patient.<Reference refidx="8"/> Measures that deliberately seek to end the life of the patient are more problematic.</ListItem><ListItem>There is probably no difference between withholding or withdrawing a potential LST because the goal in both cases  is to relieve or avoid further suffering.<Reference refidx="9"/></ListItem><ListItem>The burden and suffering associated with medical interventions from the patient’s perspective are the most important criteria for forgoing a potential LST. Distinctions between simple interventions (e.g., intravenous [IV] hydration) and more complicated interventions (e.g., mechanical ventilation) do not determine supporting the patient’s decision to forgo a treatment.<Reference refidx="10"/></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_262"><Title>Religious and Spiritual Beliefs</Title><Para id="_333">Awareness of the importance of religious beliefs and spiritual concerns within medical care has increased substantially over the last decade. National consensus guidelines, published in 2018, recommended the following:<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_334" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>That all patients receive a screening assessment for religious and spiritual concerns, followed by a more complete spiritual history.</ListItem><ListItem>That all patients receive a formal assessment by a certified chaplain.</ListItem><ListItem>That such information is placed in patient records, with follow-up at all appropriate times, including hospitalization at the EOL.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_335">An interprofessional approach is recommended: medical personnel, including physicians, nurses, and other professionals such as social workers and psychologists, are trained to address these issues and link with chaplains, as available, to evaluate and engage patients. A survey of nurses and physicians revealed that most nurses (74%) and physicians (60%) desire to provide spiritual care, which was defined as “care that supports a patient’s spiritual health.”<Reference refidx="12"/> The more commonly cited barriers associated with the estimated amount of spiritual care provided to patients included inadequate training and the belief that providing spiritual care 
is not part of the medical professional’s role. Most nurses (79%) desired training in spiritual care; fewer physicians (51%) did.</Para><Para id="_336">Evidence strongly supports that most cancer patients desire dialogue about these issues with their physicians, other staff as appropriate, and hospital chaplains, if indicated.<Reference refidx="13"/> About one-half of patients acknowledge that they are not receiving such support from a religious community, either because they are not involved in one or because they do not perceive their community as supportive.<Reference refidx="14"/> Regardless of such support, patients may report substantial spiritual distress at the EOL, ranging from as few as 10% or 15% of patients to as many as 60%.<Reference refidx="15"/> Distress may range from anger at God, to a feeling of unworthiness, to lack of meaning. Such distress, if not addressed, may complicate EOL decisions and increase depression.</Para><Para id="_263">Finally, it has been shown that addressing religious and spiritual concerns earlier in the terminal-care process substantially decreases the likelihood that patients will request aggressive EOL measures.<Reference refidx="16"/> In contrast, patients who have received strong support from their own religious communities alone are less likely to enter hospice and more likely to seek aggressive EOL care.<Reference refidx="15"/> It has also been shown that providing more comprehensive palliative care increases spiritual well-being as the EOL approaches.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_567">For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000328116" url="/about-cancer/coping/day-to-day/faith-and-spirituality/spirituality-hp-pdq">Spirituality in Cancer Care</SummaryRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_205"><Title>Artificial Hydration</Title><Para id="_206">The potential indications for artificial hydration in the final weeks or days of life may be broadly defined by the underlying goal of either temporarily reversing or halting clinical deterioration or improving the comfort of the dying patient.<Reference refidx="18"/> Although artificial hydration may be provided through enteral routes (e.g., nasogastric tubes or percutaneous gastrostomy tubes), the more common route is parenteral, either  IV  by catheter or subcutaneously through a needle (hypodermoclysis).</Para><Para id="_207">Although uncontrolled experience suggested several advantages to artificial hydration in patients with advanced cancer, a well-designed, randomized trial of 129 patients enrolled in home hospice demonstrated no benefit in   parenteral hydration (1 L of normal saline infused subcutaneously over 4 hours) compared with placebo (100 mL of normal saline infused subcutaneously over 4 hours).<Reference refidx="19"/>  There were no differences in survival, symptoms, quality of life, or delirium.</Para><Para id="_208">A prospective evaluation of the outcomes of 161 patients with advanced-stage abdominal cancers who received parenteral hydration in accordance with Japanese national guidelines near the EOL suggests there is little harm or benefit in  hydration.<Reference refidx="20"/> The median survival of the cohort was 20 days (range, 1–84 days); the mean volume of parenteral hydration was 912 ± 495 mL/day. There were no significant trends in global quality of life, discomfort, or physical symptoms for ill or good; signs of fluid retention were common but not exacerbated. However, patients expressed a high level of satisfaction with hydration and felt it was beneficial. The guidelines specify that patients with signs of volume overload should receive less than 1 L of hydration per day. When the investigators stratified patients into two groups—those who received at least 1 L of parenteral hydration per day and those who received less than 1 L per day—the prevalence of bronchial secretions was higher and hyperactive delirium was lower in the patients who received more than 1 L.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_209">Any discussion about the risks or benefits of artificial hydration must include a consideration of patient and family perspectives.<Reference refidx="21"/> Requests for artificial hydration or the desire for discussions about the role of artificial hydration seem to be driven by quality-of-life considerations as much as considerations for life prolongation.<Reference refidx="22"/>  Families may be helped with this decision when clinicians explain that use of artificial hydration in patients with cancer at the EOL has not been shown to help patients live longer or improve quality of life.  Additionally, families can be educated about good mouth care and provision of sips of water to alleviate thirst.<Reference refidx="23"/> The oncology clinician needs to approach these conversations with an open mind, recognizing that the harm caused by artificial hydration may be minimal relative to the perceived benefit, which includes reducing fatigue and increasing alertness.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_210"><Title>Artificial Nutrition</Title><Para id="_211">The following discussion excludes patients for whom artificial nutrition may facilitate further anticancer treatment or for whom bowel obstruction is the main manifestation of their advanced cancer and for whom enteral or total parenteral nutrition may be of value.<Reference refidx="25"/> Furthermore, artificial nutrition as a supplement may benefit the patient with advanced cancer who has a good performance status, a supportive home environment, and an anticipated survival longer than 3 months.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_212">The decisions about whether to provide artificial nutrition to the dying patient are similar to the decisions regarding artificial hydration. The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) recommends that individual clinical situations be assessed using clinical judgment and skill to determine when artificial nutrition is appropriate. Recognizing that the primary intention of nutrition is to benefit the patient, AAHPM concludes that withholding artificial nutrition near the EOL may be appropriate medical care if the risks outweigh the possible benefit to the patient.<Reference refidx="28"/></Para><Para id="_213">Food should be offered to patients consistent with their desires and ability to swallow. The benefit of providing artificial nutrition in the final days to weeks of life, however, is less clear. One study has concluded that artificial nutrition—specifically, parenteral nutrition—neither influenced the outcome nor improved the quality of life in terminally ill patients.<Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_214">Providing artificial nutrition to patients at the EOL is a medical intervention and requires establishing enteral or parenteral access. Considerations of financial cost, burden to patient and family of additional hospitalizations and medical procedures, and all potential complications must be weighed against any potential benefit derived from artificial nutrition support.</Para><Para id="_215">In discussions with patients, the oncology clinician needs to recognize that  the patient perception of benefit is worth exploring; as a compromise or acknowledgment of respect for the patient’s perspective, a time-limited trial may be warranted.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_216"><Title>Anti-Infectives</Title><Para id="_217">The administration of anti-infectives, primarily antibiotics, in the last days of life is common, with antibiotic use reported in patients in the last week of life at rates ranging from 27% to 78%.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]  Because of wide heterogeneity in the measurement of antibiotic use, assessment of symptom response, and lack of comparisons between patients receiving antimicrobials with those not receiving them, the benefit of antimicrobials is hard to define.<Reference refidx="31"/> One retrospective study of 133 patients in a palliative care inpatient unit found that 68% received antimicrobials in their last 14 days of life, but the indication was documented in only 12% of these patients.

Documented symptoms, including pain, dyspnea, fever, lethargy, and altered mental state, did not differ in the group that received antibiotics, compared with the patients who did not.

The decision to transfuse either packed red cells or platelets is based on a careful consideration of the overall goals of care, the imminence of death, and the likely benefit and risks of transfusions. The decision to use blood products is further complicated by the potential scarcity of the resource and the typical need for the patient to receive transfusions in a specialized unit rather than at home.</Para><Para id="_379">There are no randomized or controlled prospective trials of the indications, safety, or efficacy of transfused products. It should be recognized, however, that many patients will have received transfusions during active disease treatment or periods of supportive care.

It is important for patients, families, and proxies to understand that choices may be made to specify which supportive measures, if any, are given preceding death and at the time of death. People often believe that there is plenty of time to discuss resuscitation and the surrounding issues; however, many dying patients do not make choices in advance or have not communicated their decisions to their families, proxies, and the health care team. If these issues are unresolved at the time of EOL events, undesired support and resuscitation may result. Studies suggest that this aggressive care is associated with worse patient quality of life and worse adjustment to bereavement  for loved ones.<Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/></Para><Para id="_220">Narrowly defined, a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order instructs health care providers that, in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR, including chest compressions and/or ventilations) should not be performed and that natural death be allowed to proceed. DNR orders must be made before cardiac arrest and may be recommended by physicians when CPR is considered medically futile or would be ineffective in returning a patient to life. A DNR order may also be made at the instruction of the patient (or family or proxy) when CPR is not consistent with the goals of care.</Para><Para id="_380">It is advisable for a patient who has clear thoughts about these issues to initiate conversations with the health care team (or appointed health care agents in the outpatient setting) and to have forms completed as early as possible (i.e., before hospital admission), before the capacity to make such decisions is lost. Although patients with end-stage disease and their families are often uncomfortable bringing up the issues surrounding DNR orders, physicians and nurses can tactfully and respectfully address these issues appropriately and in a timely fashion. Lack of standardization in many institutions may contribute to ineffective and unclear discussions around DNR orders.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="24851512">Kaldjian LC: Communicating moral reasoning in medicine as an expression of respect for patients and integrity among professionals.

This complicates  EOL decision making because the treatments may prolong life, or at least are perceived as accomplishing that goal. At that point, patients or families may express ambivalence or be reluctant to withdraw treatments rather than withhold them.</Para><Para id="_383">One strategy to explore is preventing further escalation of care. The goal of this strategy is to provide a bridge between full life-sustaining treatment (LST) and comfort care, in which the goal is a good death.  It has been suggested that clinicians may encourage no escalation of care because of concerns that the intensive medical treatments will prevent death, and therefore the patient will have missed the “opportunity to die.”<Reference refidx="1"/> One study <Reference refidx="2"/> described the care of 310 patients who died in the intensive care unit (ICU) (not all of whom had cancer). For 95 patients (30%), there was a decision not to escalate care. The average time from ICU admission to deciding not to escalate care was 6 days (range, 0–37), and the average time to death was 0.8 days (range, 0–5). The interventions most likely to be withheld were dialysis, vasopressors, and blood transfusions. Fifty-five percent of the patients eventually had all life support withdrawn. The transition to comfort care did not occur before death for  the other decedents for the following reasons: waiting for family to arrive, change of family opinion, or waiting for an ethics consultation.</Para><Para id="_339">Conversely, some situations may warrant exploring with the patient and/or family a time-limited trial of intensive medical treatments. The patient or surrogates may choose to withdraw all LST if there is no improvement during the limited trial.<Reference refidx="1"/> From an ethical standpoint, withdrawing treatment is equivalent to withholding such treatment. Both actions are justified for unwarranted or unwanted intensive care.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_224"><Title>Withdrawal of Ventilatory Support</Title><Para id="_225">Two methods of withdrawal have been described: immediate extubation and terminal weaning.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_531"><Strong>Immediate extubation.</Strong> Immediate extubation includes providing parenteral opioids for analgesia and sedating agents such as midazolam, suctioning to remove excess secretions, setting the ventilator to “no assist” and turning off all alarms, and deflating the cuff and removing the endotracheal tube. Gentle suctioning of the oral cavity may be necessary, but aggressive and deep suctioning should be avoided. In some cases, patients may appear to be in significant distress. Analgesics and sedatives may be provided, even if the patient is comatose. Family members and others who are present should be warned that some movements may occur after extubation, even in patients who have no brain activity. Such movements are probably caused by hypoxia and may include gasping, moving extremities, or sitting up in bed.<Reference refidx="4"/> Immediate extubation is generally chosen when a patient has lost brain function, when a patient is comatose and unlikely to experience any suffering, or when a patient prefers a more rapid procedure.</Para><Para id="_226"><Strong>Terminal weaning.</Strong> Terminal weaning entails a more gradual process. Ventilator rate, oxygen levels, and positive end-expiratory pressure are decreased gradually over a period of 30 minutes to a few hours. A patient who survives may be placed on a T-piece; this may be left in place, or extubation may proceed. There is some evidence that the gradual process in a patient who may experience distress allows clinicians to assess pain and dyspnea and to modify the sedative and analgesic regimen accordingly.<Reference refidx="5"/> In a study of 31 patients undergoing terminal weaning, most patients remained comfortable, as assessed by a variety of physiological measures, when low doses of opioids and benzodiazepines were administered. The average time to death in this study was 24 hours, although two patients survived to be discharged to hospice.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_227">Paralytic agents have no analgesic or sedative effects, and they can mask patient discomfort. These neuromuscular blockers need to be discontinued before extubation. Guidelines suggest that these agents should never be introduced when the ventilator is being withdrawn; in general, when patients have been receiving paralytic agents, these agents need to be withdrawn before extubation. The advantage of withdrawal of the neuromuscular blocker is the resultant ability of the health care provider to better assess the patient’s comfort level and to allow possible interaction between the patient and loved ones. One notable exception to withdrawal of the paralytic agent is when death is expected to be rapid after the removal of the ventilator and when waiting for the drug to reverse might place an unreasonable burden on the patient and family.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_228">Regardless of the technique employed, the patient and setting must be prepared. Monitors and alarms are turned off, and life-prolonging interventions such as antibiotics and transfusions need to be discontinued. Family members should be given sufficient time to prepare, including planning for the presence of all loved ones who wish to be in attendance. They need to be given information about what to expect during the process; some may elect to remain out of the room during extubation. Chaplains or social workers may be called to provide support to the family.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="19326315">Cochrane TI: Unnecessary time pressure in refusal of life-sustaining therapies: fear of missing the opportunity to die.

Pain, loss of control over one’s life, and fear of future suffering were unbearable when symptom intensity was high.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_476"><Title>Informal caregiver perspectives</Title><Para id="_477">Caregiver suffering is a complex construct that refers to severe distress in caregivers’ physical, psychosocial, and spiritual well-being. Several studies have reported strong associations between patients’ and caregivers’ emotional states. In a systematic review of 19 descriptive studies of caregivers during the palliative, hospice, and bereavement phases, analysis of patient-caregiver dyads found mutuality between the patient’s condition and the caregiver’s response. Caregivers were found to be at increased risk of  physical and psychological burden across studies, with caregiver distress sometimes exceeding that of the patient.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_478">Several studies have categorized caregiver suffering with the use of dyadic analysis. In a qualitative study involving 22 dyadic semistructured interviews, caregivers dealing with advanced medical illness, including cancer, reported both unique and shared forms of suffering. Suffering was characterized as powerlessness, threat to the caregiver’s identity, and demands exceeding resources.<Reference refidx="3"/> Because caregiver suffering can affect patient well-being and result in complicated bereavement, early identification and support of caregiver suffering are optimal.<Reference refidx="4"/> For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000681705" url="/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-hp-pdq">Informal Caregivers in Cancer: Roles, Burden, and Support</SummaryRef>.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_232"><Title>Palliative Sedation</Title><Para id="_233">Palliative sedation may be defined as the deliberate pharmacological lowering of the level of consciousness, with the goal of relieving symptoms that are unacceptably distressing to the patient and refractory to optimal palliative care interventions. In considering a patient’s request for palliative sedation, clinicians need to identify any personal biases that may adversely affect their ability to respond effectively to such requests. Several points need to be borne in mind:</Para><ItemizedList id="_381" Style="bullet"><ListItem>There is no evidence that palliative sedation shortens life expectancy when applied in the last days of life.<Reference refidx="5"/></ListItem><ListItem>The goal of palliative sedation is to relieve intractable suffering.</ListItem><ListItem>Discussions about palliative sedation may lead to insights into how to better care for the dying person. For example, requests for palliative sedation may create an opportunity to understand the implications of symptoms for the suffering person and to encourage the clinician to try alternative interventions to relieve symptoms.</ListItem><ListItem>When dealing with requests for palliative sedation, health care professionals need to consider their own cultural and religious biases and reflect on the commitment they make as clinicians to the dying person.<Reference refidx="6"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_340">The following questions may serve to organize discussions about the appropriateness of palliative sedation within health care teams and between clinicians,  patients, and families:</Para><ItemizedList id="_234" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>What are the indications for palliative sedation?</ListItem><ListItem>Has the patient received optimal palliative care short of palliative sedation?</ListItem><ListItem>What is the intended level of consciousness?</ListItem><ListItem>Will the palliative sedation be maintained continuously until death or adjusted to reassess the patient’s symptom distress?</ListItem><ListItem>What are the plans for discontinuation or maintenance of hydration, nutrition, or other potentially life-sustaining treatments (LSTs)?</ListItem></ItemizedList><SummarySection id="_479"><Title>Indications for palliative sedation</Title><Para id="_480">The two broad indications for palliative sedation are refractory physical symptoms and refractory existential or psychological distress. A retrospective study at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston included 1,207 patients admitted to the palliative care unit. Palliative sedation was used in 15% of admissions. The most common indications were delirium (82%) and dyspnea (6%).<Reference refidx="7"/> </Para><Para id="_481">The use of palliative sedation for refractory existential or psychological symptoms is highly controversial. In a survey of the attitudes and experiences of more than 1,000 U.S. physicians toward intentional sedation to unconsciousness until death revealed that 68% of respondents opposed palliative sedation for existential distress. Of note, only 10% of physician respondents had prescribed palliative sedation in the preceding 12 months.<Reference refidx="8"/> A previous survey conducted by the same research group reported that only 18% of surveyed physicians objected to “sedation to unconsciousness in dying patients” without a specified indication.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_482">One potential objection or concern related to palliative sedation for refractory existential or psychological distress is unrecognized but potentially remediable depression. For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592#_242" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">Requests for Hastened Death</SummaryRef> section.</Para><Para id="_483">Further objections or concerns include (1) whether the principle of <Emphasis>double effect,</Emphasis> an ethical basis for the use of palliative sedation for refractory physical distress, is adequate justification; and (2) cultural expectations about psychological or existential suffering at the EOL. The principle of double effect is based on the concept of proportionality. When applied to palliative sedation, this principle supports the idea that the intended effect of palliative sedation (i.e., relief of suffering) may justify a foreseeable-but-unintended consequence (such as possibly shortening  life expectancy—although this is not supported by data, as mentioned <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592#_381" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">above</SummaryRef>—or eliminating the opportunity to interact with loved ones) if the intended (positive) outcome is of greater value than the unintended (negative) outcome.<Reference refidx="10"/> Thus, in the case of palliative sedation for refractory psychological or existential distress, the perception that palliative sedation is not justified may reflect a devaluation of the distress associated with such suffering or that other means with fewer  negative consequences have not been fully explored.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_484"><Title>Intended level of sedation</Title><Para id="_485">Another decision to be made  is whether the intended level of sedation is unconsciousness or a level associated with relief of the distress attributed to physical or psychological symptoms. In a survey of U.S. physicians,<Reference refidx="8"/> two-thirds of respondents felt that unconsciousness was an acceptable unintended consequence of palliative sedation, but deliberate unconsciousness was unacceptable. This finding may relate to the sense of proportionality. A qualitative study of 54 physicians who had administered palliative sedation indicated that physicians who were more concerned with ensuring that suffering was relieved were more likely to administer palliative sedation to unconsciousness. Physicians who chose mild sedation were guided more by their assessment of the patient’s condition.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_486"><Title>Intended duration of sedation</Title><Para id="_487">Palliative sedation may be provided either intermittently or continuously until death. If a clinician anticipates that a distressing symptom will improve with time, then that  clinician should discuss with the patient any recommendations about a deliberate reduction in the depth of sedation to assess whether the symptoms persist. Furthermore, deliberate reductions in the depth of sedation may be appropriate if there is a desire for communication with loved ones.</Para><Para id="_524">For example, a single-center observational study monitored 89 (mostly male) hospice patients with cancer who received either intermittent or continuous palliative sedation with midazolam, propofol, and/or phenobarbital for delirium (61%), dyspnea (20%), or pain (15%). Mental status changes in the 37 patients who received intermittent palliative sedation for delirium were as follows, after sedation was lightened: 43.2% unchanged, 40.6% improved, and 16.2% worsened. Unsurprisingly, mental status remained the same or worsened for all patients who received continuous palliative sedation for delirium. Notably, median survival time was only 1 day for patients who received continuous sedation, compared to 6 days for the intermittent palliative sedation group, though the authors hypothesize that this difference may be attributed to a poorer baseline clinical condition in the patients who received continuous sedation rather than to a direct effect of continuous sedation.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_488"><Title>Role of potentially LSTs during palliative sedation</Title><Para id="_489">The intent of palliative sedation is to relieve suffering; it is not to shorten life. The decision to discontinue or maintain treatments such as artificial hydration or nutrition requires a review of the patient’s goals of care and the potential for benefit or harm. In general, the absence of evidence for benefit seems to justify recommendations to forgo LSTs in the context of palliative sedation. On the other hand, open lines of communication and a respectful and responsive awareness of a patient’s preferences are important to maintain during the dying process, so the clinician should not overstate the potential risks of hydration or nutrition. There is consensus that decisions about LSTs are  distinct from the decision to administer palliative sedation.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_242"><Title>Requests for Hastened Death</Title><SummarySection id="_490"><Title>Potential reasons for requests</Title><Para id="_491">Requests for hastened death or statements that express a desire to die vary from expression of a temporary or passive wish to a sustained interest in interventions to  end life or a statement of intent to plan or die by suicide.<Reference refidx="13"/> Reliable data on the frequency of requests for hastened death are not available.</Para><Para id="_492">Requests for hastened death provide the oncology clinician with an opportunity to explore and respond to the dying patient’s experience in an attentive and compassionate manner. From the patient’s perspective, the reasons for requests for hastened death are multiple and complex and include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_493" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Depression or a sense of hopelessness.<Reference refidx="14"/></ListItem><ListItem>Uncontrollable pain or other physical symptoms, with decreased quality of life.<Reference refidx="15"/></ListItem><ListItem>Loss of personal identity and social relations.<Reference refidx="16"/></ListItem><ListItem>To avoid being a burden to others.<Reference refidx="17"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_494">The cited studies summarize the patient’s perspectives.

Specific studies are not available. The first and most important consideration is for health care providers to maintain awareness of their personal reactions to requests or statements. It is imperative that the oncology clinician expresses a supportive and accepting attitude.
