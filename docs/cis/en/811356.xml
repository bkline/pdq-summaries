A similar study compared the risk of primary breast cancer in <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName>-related ovarian cancer patients and unaffected carriers.<Reference refidx="24"/>  The 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year risks of primary breast cancer were all statistically significantly lower in patients with ovarian cancer.  The risk of CBC among women with a unilateral breast cancer before their ovarian cancer diagnosis was also lower than in women without ovarian cancer, although the difference did not reach statistical significance.

Ovarian cancer onset  typically occurs 8 to 10 years later in patients with a <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> pathogenic variant than in patients with a <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> pathogenic variant. Hence, NCCN states that it is reasonable to postpone RRSO until age 40 to 45 years in most patients with a <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> pathogenic variant. However, RRSO may be performed at a younger age if individuals with a <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> pathogenic variant have a family member who had ovarian cancer at a young age.<Reference refidx="102"/> Optimal timing for RRSO is individualized, but evaluating a woman's risk of ovarian cancer based on pathogenic variant status can be helpful in the decision-making process. In a large study of American <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> families, age-specific cumulative risk of ovarian cancer at age 40 years was 4.7% for <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> carriers and 1.9% for <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> carriers.<Reference refidx="103"/> In a combined analysis of 22 studies of  <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> carriers, risk of ovarian cancer for <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> carriers increased the most from the ages of 40  to 50 years. The risk of ovarian cancer for <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> carriers increased sharply from the ages of 50  to 60 years.<Reference refidx="104"/> A Markov model studying  a hypothetical cohort of patients with <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> pathogenic variants found that the optimal strategy for improving survival was to proceed with RRSO as early as possible.<Reference refidx="105"/> However, this mathematical model did not consider patient decision making. In this model, the ovarian cancer cluster region may be associated with lower life expectancy estimates when compared with the breast cancer cluster regions or the noncluster regions. However, this did not significantly change life expectancy outcomes unless RRSO was significantly delayed. In summary, women with <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> pathogenic variants may want to consider RRSO for ovarian cancer risk reduction at an earlier age than women with <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> pathogenic variants.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_3906"><Title>Concomitant hysterectomy at time of RRSO</Title><Para id="_3907">The role of concomitant hysterectomy at the time of RRSO in <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> carriers is controversial.

In women with HRD cancers, the median PFS was 13.6 versus 5.4 months (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.24–0.42). On the basis of these data, the authors concluded that platinum sensitivity alone was a sufficient marker to predict benefit from rucaparib in women with advanced high-grade ovarian cancer, without requiring additional HRD or <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> testing.<Reference refidx="75"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_3727"><Title>Niraparib</Title><Para id="_3728">Niraparib is a selective inhibitor of PARP-1 and -2.

Consistent with prior data, patients with germline <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> pathogenic  variants had the longest PFS of the three groups. Based upon the broad activity of niraparib maintenance in heavily pretreated women with ovarian cancer, regardless of platinum response or variant status, the <ProtocolRef nct_id="NCT02354586">QUADRA</ProtocolRef> phase II trial studied the antitumor activity of niraparib in 463 women with recurrent, measurable ovarian cancer.
