Later, William Kelley, a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000389460" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">dentist</GlossaryTermRef>, further developed Dr. Beard’s ideas and published the results of his own practice. Impressed by these findings, Dr. Gonzalez began working closely with Dr. Kelley. The Gonzalez regimen combines the work of Dr. Gonzalez and Dr. Kelley with the theories and practice of Dr. Max Gerson. Dr. Gerson also treated cancer with diet and nutritional supplements.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_35"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that the Gonzalez regimen is useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_52">Supporters of the Gonzalez regimen believe that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046622" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">toxins</GlossaryTermRef> (harmful substances) in the environment and in processed foods cause cancer to form in the body. These toxins are said to build up in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">tissues</GlossaryTermRef> of the body, preventing important body processes from working correctly and letting cancer develop. The theory is that if these toxins could be destroyed and removed from the body, cancer would stop growing.</Para><Para id="_53">The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046254" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">pancreas</GlossaryTermRef> secretes enzymes, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">proteins</GlossaryTermRef> that help digest food. The Gonzalez regimen is based on the theory that pancreatic enzymes also help the body get rid of toxins that lead to cancer. The coffee enemas are added because they are believed to improve the liver’s ability to remove toxins from the body.</Para><Para id="_54">The diets used in the Gonzalez regimen are planned for each patient’s <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446118" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">metabolic type</GlossaryTermRef>. Metabolic typing is a theory that people fall into one of three groups based on the main type of food (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">protein</GlossaryTermRef>,   <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285960" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">carb</GlossaryTermRef>, or mixed) that their bodies need to stay healthy. Certain tests, including looking at the patient’s hair under a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000638184" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">microscope</GlossaryTermRef>, are used to decide a patient’s metabolic type. The theory is that a diet that is correct for the patient’s metabolic type will keep the body healthy and better able to prevent or fight cancer.

Between 130 and 160 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">doses</GlossaryTermRef> of other nutritional supplements are taken by mouth each day. The patients also eat a special diet and have coffee enemas twice a day.  </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_39"><Question>Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using the Gonzalez regimen?</Question><Answer><Para id="_55">Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">drug</GlossaryTermRef>, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans.

In 1993, he reported selected results of the study to the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044266" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">National Cancer Institute</GlossaryTermRef> (NCI). Patients treated with the Gonzalez regimen lived a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000655249" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">median</GlossaryTermRef> of 17 months, which is longer than usual for patients with this disease. Most patients with advanced pancreatic cancer live less than a year.</Para><Para id="_58">Because of the small number of patients in the study, and for other reasons, the NCI and the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) decided that the results were not clear and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044079" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">prospective studies</GlossaryTermRef> were encouraged. In prospective studies, patients are followed forward in time. The NCI and  the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454777" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</GlossaryTermRef> (NCCIH) sponsored a second study with a much larger number of patients.

During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutIACT_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutIACT_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutIACT_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutIACT_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutIACT_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Therapies</Title><Para id="_AboutIACT_7">It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutIACT_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm.</Para><Para id="_AboutIACT_9"><ExternalRef xref="https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM).
