Other factors, such as your preferences and overall health, are also important.</Para><Para id="_4">An important factor for some women is fertility preservation. If you would like to retain the ability to become pregnant, ask your doctor about fertility-sparing treatment options (treatments for cervical cancer that preserve the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046645" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">uterus</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046687" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">ovaries</GlossaryTermRef>). Such treatments may be an option for some small cancers that are only in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046133" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cervix</GlossaryTermRef>. If your cancer is more advanced or has a high chance of coming back, you are more likely to have treatments that will prevent you from becoming pregnant. A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000780360" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">reproductive endocrinologist</GlossaryTermRef> can help you understand your options for becoming a parent, such as freezing eggs.
