mechanism of action.  It appears to have been developed in the 1960s on the
basis of earlier studies that used a high-magnification <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044021" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">dark-field microscope</GlossaryTermRef> called
a somatoscope.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  With dark-field microscopes, researchers are able
to examine living <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cells</GlossaryTermRef> in samples of fresh <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270735" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">blood</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> taken from
healthy individuals and individuals with serious diseases, including
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_13">The developer of 714-X states that the study of living cells (as opposed to the dead cells examined with a
conventional <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044052" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">light microscope</GlossaryTermRef>
or an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044025" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">electron microscope</GlossaryTermRef>)
led to the theory that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044059" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">microorganisms</GlossaryTermRef> distinct from  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044123" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">bacteria</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045941" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">viruses</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044571" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">fungi</GlossaryTermRef> exist normally in the blood and play
a role in the development of cancer.  These microorganisms, which are called
somatids, are said to exist in multiple forms, some of which appear only in
individuals <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460124" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">affected</GlossaryTermRef> by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044138" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">degenerative</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045772" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">malignant</GlossaryTermRef> diseases.  The forms associated
with degenerative diseases or cancer reportedly secrete growth <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045713" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">hormones</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043986" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">toxic</GlossaryTermRef> substances that disrupt
normal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044126" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cellular metabolism</GlossaryTermRef> and damage
the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">immune system</GlossaryTermRef>.  In this compromised environment, cells that have become
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cancerous</GlossaryTermRef> are allowed to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044572" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">proliferate</GlossaryTermRef>.  It was also suggested
that cancer cells trap nitrogen, thereby depriving the rest of the body of the
nitrogen needed for normal cellular metabolism.  In addition, it was proposed
that cancer cells secrete a toxic substance, cocancerogenic K factor, that
further inhibits the immune system.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_14">The producers of 714-X state that cancer can be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">diagnosed</GlossaryTermRef>, and its
development and spread can be predicted, by studying blood samples with the
somatoscope.  No evidence has been published in peer-reviewed scientific
journals to support these proposals, and the somatidian theory of cancer
development is not widely accepted.</Para><Para id="_15">714-X reportedly works by protecting, stabilizing, and reactivating the
patient’s immune system so that the body can defend itself against cancer cell
growth and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046710" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">metastasis</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  714-X is said to accomplish this, in part, by helping to increase the
“fluidity” of  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046305" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">lymph</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="3"/> In addition, the
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044001" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">camphor</GlossaryTermRef> component of 714-X is purportedly attracted to cancer cells, where the
added nitrogen is released, thus preventing malignant cells from depleting the
nitrogen required by normal cells (including immune system cells) for proper
metabolism and function.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="9645177" MedlineID="98309047">Kaegi E: Unconventional therapies for cancer: 6. 714-X.

integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>, a scoring system has been devised that allows
studies of individual treatments to be ranked according to the strength of
their evidence (i.e., their level of evidence).  Not all studies, however,
are given a level of evidence score.  To be eligible, a study must:</Para><ItemizedList id="_42" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Evaluate
a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043985" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">therapeutic</GlossaryTermRef> outcome(s), such as

survival, or carefully measured improvement in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem> Be reported in

In addition to scoring individual studies, a summary of the evidence is usually made.</Para><Para id="_26">Because no study of the use of 714-X in humans has been reported in a
peer-reviewed scientific journal, no level of evidence <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390238" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">analysis</GlossaryTermRef> is possible
for this treatment.  Therefore, at this time, the use of 714-X as a treatment
for cancer cannot be recommended outside the context of well-designed <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_27"> For additional information about <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446533" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">levels of evidence</GlossaryTermRef> analysis, refer to <SummaryRef href="CDR0000256874" url="/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/cam">Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies</SummaryRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_38"><SectMetaData><SectionType>Changes to summary</SectionType></SectMetaData><Title>Latest Updates to This Summary (08/22/2018)</Title><Para id="_39">The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044271" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">PDQ</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as
