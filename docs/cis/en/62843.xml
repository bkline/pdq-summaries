This integrated classification is intended to define more homogeneous entities that will improve the accuracy of diagnoses, refine prognoses, and more reliably reach conclusions regarding treatment strategies.</Para><Para id="_1893">The 2021 WHO classification continues to classify ependymal tumors on the basis of anatomical site (i.e., supratentorial, posterior fossa, spinal), histopathological features (i.e., subependymoma, myxopapillary ependymoma, ependymoma), and molecular features (i.e., supratentorial ependymoma with <GeneName>ZFTA</GeneName> [formerly called <GeneName>C11orf95</GeneName>] or <GeneName>YAP1</GeneName> fusions, posterior fossa A or B, and spinal ependymoma with <GeneName>MYCN</GeneName> amplification). The updated classification also includes ependymal tumors defined by anatomical location and histology but not by molecular alteration. Examples include cases where the tumor contains a unique molecular alteration (in such cases, the term not elsewhere classified [NEC] is used) or when molecular analysis fails or is not feasible (in these cases, the term not otherwise specified [NOS] is used).<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_36">Ependymal tumors are now classified into the following three main histological subtypes:<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>
</Para><OrderedList id="_387" Style="Arabic"><ListItem><Strong>Subependymoma (WHO grade 1):</Strong> A subependymoma is a slow-growing neoplasm, typically attached to the ventricle wall. It is composed of glial tumor cell clusters embedded in a fibrillary matrix.  <Para id="_330">The true incidence of subependymomas (WHO grade 1) is difficult to determine. These tumors are frequently asymptomatic and may be found incidentally at autopsy.  Subependymomas probably comprise less than 5% of all ependymal tumors.  </Para><Para id="_1838">A diagnosis of subependymoma in a child is questionable, and  further review or molecular analysis should be considered.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Myxopapillary ependymoma (WHO grade 2):</Strong> A myxopapillary ependymoma arises almost exclusively in the location of the conus medullaris, cauda equina, and filum terminale of the spinal cord. They are characterized histologically by tumor cells arranged in a papillary manner around vascularized myxoid stromal cores. Myxopapillary ependymoma is now considered WHO grade 2, rather than grade 1, because its recurrence rate is similar to conventional spinal ependymoma.<Reference refidx="4"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Ependymoma: </Strong>Ependymoma originates from the walls of the ventricles or from the spinal canal and are composed of neoplastic ependymal cells.  <Para id="_1894">In the 2016 WHO revision, anaplastic ependymoma was eliminated as a subtype. In the 2021 WHO revision, papillary, clear cell, and tanycytic ependymoma were removed as subtypes because they were of no clinicopathologic utility. They are now included as patterns when describing the histopathology of an ependymoma.</Para><Para id="_1895">Grading of ependymoma has been fraught with issues of reproducibility and clinical usefulness, especially in molecularly defined ependymoma. Therefore, the 2021 WHO classification allows only a histologically defined diagnosis of ependymoma in the integrated diagnosis (i.e., anaplastic ependymoma is no longer allowed), but a pathologist can choose to assign WHO grade 2 or 3 on the basis of the histopathological features. Grade 3 ependymoma, compared with grade 2 ependymoma, shows increased cellularity and mitotic activity, often associated with microvascular proliferation and necrosis.
