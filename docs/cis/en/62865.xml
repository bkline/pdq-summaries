There are a number of commercially available tools (not addressed in this summary) that also offer risk assessment and/or facilitate genetic evaluation. These brief and simple screening tools may be administered to patients in a provider's waiting room or online prior to a visit. Some tools are publicly available and can be accessed directly by patients.

For example, there is variability in the tools' abilities to flag at-risk individuals based on extensive criteria, as outlined by current professional society guidelines (e.g., NCCN). Hence, some people who are candidates for genetic counseling and genetic testing will be missed by these tools. This includes individuals who may be considered low-risk based on these screening tools. Because of the potential clinical utility of genetic testing, clinical judgement may still be needed to determine the appropriateness of genetic counseling and testing in these individuals.

protection of patient confidentiality and privacy.  This is facilitated through a combination of 
rapport building and information gathering; establishing or verifying
diagnoses; risk assessment and calculation of quantitative
occurrence/recurrence risks; education and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044677" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">informed consent</GlossaryTermRef> processes;
psychosocial assessment, support, and counseling appropriate to a family’s
culture and ethnicity; and other relevant background characteristics.<Reference refidx="16"/> The psychosocial assessment is especially important in the genetic counseling process because individuals most vulnerable to adverse effects of genetic information may include those who have had difficulty dealing with stressful life events in the past.<Reference refidx="17"/>  Variables that may influence psychosocial adjustment to genetic information include individual and familial factors; cultural factors; and health system factors such as the type of test, disease status, and risk information.

This meta-analysis also showed that these tools  had high completion rates (average completion rate, 86%) and were more comprehensive when compared with paper-based surveys and clinician interviews.<Reference refidx="12"/> In these studies, family history collection occurred in one of two ways: 1) online before visits, or 2) in clinic via kiosks or electronic tablets. However, it was challenging to integrate tool-collected information into electronic medical records, and functionality was also an issue.

Methods to calculate risk utilize health history information and risk factor and family history data often in combination with emerging biologic and genetic/genomic evidence to establish predictions.<Reference refidx="48"/>  Multiple methodologies are used to calculate risk, including statistical models, prevalence data from specific populations, penetrance data when a documented pathogenic variant has been identified in a family, mendelian inheritance, and Bayesian analysis.  All models have distinct capabilities, weaknesses, and limitations based on the methodology, sample size, and/or population used to create the model.

Models  and prevalence data are most effective when they are applied to   the populations that are best suited for their use. For instance, a model or prevalence data derived from a population study of individuals older than 35 years may not accurately be applied in a population aged 35 years and younger.   Care must be taken when interpreting the data obtained from various risk models because they differ with regard to what is actually being estimated. Some models estimate the risk of a pathogenic variant being present in the family; others estimate the risk of a pathogenic variant being present in the individual being counseled. Some models estimate the risk of specific cancers developing in an individual, while others estimate more than one of the data above.

Similar to pathogenic variant probability assessments, cancer risk calculations are also complex and necessitate a detailed health history and family history.  In the presence of a documented pathogenic variant, cancer risk estimates can be derived from peer-reviewed penetrance data.  Penetrance data are constantly being refined and many genetic variants have variable penetrance because other variables may impact the absolute risk of cancer in any given patient.  Modifiers of cancer risk in carriers of pathogenic variants include the variant's effect on the function of the gene/protein (e.g., variant type and position), the contributions of modifier genes, and personal and environmental factors (e.g., the impact of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy performed for other indications in a woman who harbors a <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> pathogenic variant).<Reference refidx="54"/>  When there is evidence of an inherited susceptibility to cancer but genetic testing has not been performed, analysis of the pedigree can be used to estimate cancer risk.  This type of calculation uses the probability the individual harbors a genetic variant and variant-specific penetrance data to calculate cancer risk.<Reference refidx="51"/></Para><Para id="_295">In the absence of evidence of a hereditary cancer syndrome, several methods can be utilized to estimate cancer risk.  Relative risk data from studies of specific risk factors provide ratios of observed versus expected cancers associated with a given risk factor.  However, utilizing relative risk data for individualized risk assessment can have significant limitations: relative risk calculations will differ based on the type of control group and other study-associated biases, and comparability across studies can vary widely.<Reference refidx="52"/> In addition, relative risks are lifetime ratios and do not provide age-specific calculations, nor can the relative risk be multiplied by population risk to provide an individual's risk estimate.<Reference refidx="52"/><Reference refidx="55"/></Para><Para id="_296">In spite of these limitations, disease-specific cumulative risk estimates are most often employed in clinical settings.  These estimates usually provide risk for a given time interval and can be anchored to cumulative risks of other health conditions in a given population (e.g., the 5-year risk by the Gail model).<Reference refidx="52"/><Reference refidx="55"/> Cumulative risk models have limitations that may underestimate or overestimate risk. For example, the Gail model excludes paternal family histories of breast cancer.<Reference refidx="50"/> Furthermore, many of these models were constructed from data derived from predominantly white populations and may have limited validity when used to estimate risk in other ethnicities.<Reference refidx="56"/></Para><Para id="_297">Cumulative risk estimates are best used when evidence of other underlying significant risk factors have been ruled out.  Careful evaluation of an individual's personal health and family history can identify other confounding risk factors that may outweigh a risk estimate derived from a cumulative risk model.  For example, a woman with a prior biopsy showing lobular carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> (LCIS) whose mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 65 years has a greater lifetime risk from her history of LCIS than her cumulative lifetime risk of breast cancer based on one first-degree relative.<Reference refidx="57"/><Reference refidx="58"/>  In this circumstance, recommendations for cancer risk management would be based on the risk associated with her LCIS.

Failure of the laboratory to detect a pathogenic variant in an affected family member does not rule out an inherited basis for the cancer in that family.  Reasons why testing could be uninformative include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_315" Style="bullet"><ListItem>The cancer in the family may be associated with a cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460209" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">susceptibility gene</GlossaryTermRef> other than the gene that was tested.</ListItem><ListItem>The cancer in the family may be associated with a pathogenic variant, but the cancer in the specific family member who underwent testing is not associated with that variant.

This result means that a genetic variant has been found; however, the extent that this variant increases cancer risk, or whether it is associated with the history of cancer in the family, is uncertain.  In this circumstance, some clues as to the significance of the variant can be derived from the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_1093" Style="bullet"><ListItem>The location of the variant in relation to regions and function of a gene.</ListItem><ListItem>The specific change; since many variants are <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000783964" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">missense variants</GlossaryTermRef>, not all amino acid substitutions are as significant.</ListItem><ListItem>Whether the variant has been documented in the presence of a documented pathogenic variant.</ListItem><ListItem>Whether the variant is associated with the branch in the family with the cancer and/or whether the variant tracks with the cancers in the family.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_1094">Unfortunately, even with this information, there is often insufficient evidence to document the significance of a specific variant, and further clarifying research is required.</Para><Para id="_85">If there is no close, living, affected relative to undergo testing, or the living affected relative declines testing, other options may be
discussed with the patient and the testing laboratory.  In rare instances, if proper authorization is secured from the family, testing the stored tissue of a deceased relative may be considered. However, genetic tests done on stored tissue are technically difficult and may not yield a definitive result.  Therefore, testing an
unaffected person without prior testing of an affected family member may be performed.  In these instances, counseling includes discussing that a negative test result does not rule out the
presence of a cancer susceptibility gene in the family or in the patient  and may be uninformative.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_307"><Title>Testing in families with a documented pathogenic variant</Title><Para id="_308">Genetic testing for a documented familial pathogenic variant can be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460156" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">informative</GlossaryTermRef> and will yield one of the following  results (for more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865#_1095" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/risk-assessment-hp-pdq">Figure 1</SummaryRef>):</Para><ItemizedList id="_309" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Positive for the familial pathogenic variant.</ListItem><ListItem>Negative for the familial pathogenic variant.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_310">If the familial pathogenic variant is detected in a family member, their cancer risks are based on penetrance data for pathogenic variants in that specific gene.

The ACA does not stipulate that follow-up care based on genetic test results be covered (e.g., risk-reducing surgeries). However, some insurance companies require that pretest genetic counseling be performed by a credentialed genetics provider before testing is authorized.   Before testing is ordered, it is important to verify costs and insurance coverage, including for Medicaid and Medicare patients.  Medicare does not cover genetic testing if the patient has not had a cancer diagnosis associated with the pathogenic variants for which testing is ordered.  In addition, unaffected individuals with Medicare are not covered for testing, even if they are tested for only a known familial pathogenic variant.  Further, Medicare does not cover genetic counseling as a separately billable service.<Reference refidx="8"/>  For individuals without insurance coverage and the underinsured, some laboratories offer low-cost options or have financial assistance programs.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_318"><Title>Genetic testing and assisted reproductive technology</Title><Para id="_1368">There is a risk of carriers passing on cancer-associated pathogenic variants to offspring.

This observation is consistent with a founder effect, wherein a pathogenic variant identified in a contemporary population can be traced back to a small group of founders isolated by geographic, cultural, or other factors. For example, two specific <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> pathogenic variants (68_69delAG and 5266dup, also known in the literature as 185delAG and 5382insC) and one <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> pathogenic variant (5946delT, also known as 6174delT) have been reported to be common in Ashkenazi Jews. Other genes also have reported <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000783962" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">founder pathogenic variants</GlossaryTermRef>. The presence of founder pathogenic variants has practical implications for genetic testing.

CLIA regulations address personnel qualifications, laboratory quality assurance standards, and documentation and validation of tests and procedures.<Reference refidx="49"/>  For laboratory tests themselves, CLIA categorizes tests based on the level of complexity into waived tests, moderate complexity, or high complexity.  Genetic tests are considered high complexity, which indicates that a high degree of knowledge and skill is required to perform or interpret the test.  Laboratories conducting high complexity tests must undergo proficiency testing at specified intervals, which consists of an external review of the laboratory's ability to accurately perform and interpret the test.<Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="50"/> However, a specialty area specific for molecular and biologic genetic tests has yet to be established; therefore, specific proficiency testing of genetic testing laboratories is not required by CLIA.<Reference refidx="48"/></Para><Para id="_288">In regard to analytic validity, genetic tests fall into two primary categories; test kits and laboratory-developed tests (previously called home brews).  Test kits are manufactured for use in laboratories performing the test and include all the reagents necessary to complete the analysis, instructions, performance outcomes, and details about which genetic variants can be detected.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates test kits as medical devices; however, despite more than 1,000 available genetic tests, there are fewer than ten FDA-approved test kits.<Reference refidx="50"/> Laboratory-developed tests are performed in a laboratory that assembles its own testing materials in-house;<Reference refidx="50"/> this category represents the most common form of genetic testing.  Laboratory-developed tests are subject to the least amount of oversight, as neither CLIA nor the FDA evaluate the laboratories' proficiency in performing the test or clinical validity relative to the accuracy of the test to predict a clinical outcome.<Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="50"/>  The FDA does regulate manufactured analyte-specific reagents (ASRs) as medical devices.  These small molecules are used to conduct laboratory-developed tests but can also be made by the laboratory.  ASRs made in the laboratory are not subject to FDA oversight.  For laboratory-developed tests utilizing manufactured commercially available ASRs, the FDA requires that the test be ordered by a health professional or other individual authorized to order the test by state law.  However, this regulation does not distinguish between health providers caring for the patient or health providers who work for the laboratory offering the test.<Reference refidx="50"/></Para><Para id="_289">In addition to the regulation of classical clinical genetic tests is the regulatory oversight of research genetic testing. Laboratories performing genetic testing on a research basis are exempt from CLIA oversight if the laboratory does not report patient-specific results for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment or the assessment of the health of individual patients.<Reference refidx="48"/>  However, there are anecdotal reports of research laboratories providing test results for clinical purposes with the caveat that the laboratory recommends that testing be repeated in a clinical CLIA-approved laboratory.  In addition, there is no established mechanism that determines when a test has sufficient analytic and clinical validity to be offered clinically.<Reference refidx="50"/>  Currently, the decision to offer a genetic test clinically is at the discretion of the laboratory director.</Para><Para id="_290">Evidence regarding the implications of this narrow regulatory oversight of genetic tests is limited and consists predominantly of laboratory director responses to quality assurance surveys.

Eight percent of laboratories did not employ and were not affiliated with doctoral-level genetics professionals.  Laboratory-developed tests were performed in 70% of laboratories.  Sixty-three percent of laboratories provided an interpretation of the test result as part of the test report.<Reference refidx="51"/>  Another survey of 190 laboratory directors found that 97% were CLIA-certified for high complexity testing.

an integral part of the pretest counseling process.<Reference refidx="86"/>  This view is driven
by several ethical dilemmas that can arise in genetic susceptibility testing.  The most cited concern is the
possibility of insurance or employment discrimination if a test result, or even
the fact that an individual has sought or is seeking testing, is disclosed.  In 2008, Congress passed the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865#_1792" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/risk-assessment-hp-pdq">Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA)</SummaryRef>.

A related issue involves
stigmatization that may occur when an individual who may never develop the
condition in question, or may not do so for decades, receives genetic
information and is labeled or labels himself or herself as ill.  Finally, in the case
of genetic testing, medical information given to one individual
has immediate implications for biological relatives.  These implications include
not only the medical risks but also disruptions in familial relationships.  The
possibility for coercion exists when one family member wants to be tested but,
to do so optimally, must first obtain genetic material or information from
other family members.</Para><Para id="_228">Inclusion of an informed consent process in counseling can facilitate patient autonomy.<Reference refidx="88"/>  It may also reduce the potential for misunderstanding
between patient and provider.  Many clinical programs provide opportunities for
individuals to review their informed consent during the genetic testing and
counseling process.  Initial informed consent provides a
verbal and/or written overview of the process.  </Para><Para id="_229">Some programs use a second informed consent process before disclosure to the

occurs.  This discussion concerns issues regarding sharing the genetic test result with
health providers and/or interested family members, currently or in the future.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_233"><Title>Testing in children</Title><Para id="_234">Genetic testing for pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes in children is particularly complex.  While both parents <Reference refidx="92"/> and providers <Reference refidx="93"/> may request or recommend testing for minor children, many experts recommend that unless there is evidence that the test result will influence the medical management of the child or adolescent, genetic testing should be deferred until legal adulthood (age 18 y or older) because of concerns about autonomy, potential discrimination, and possible psychosocial effects.<Reference refidx="94"/><Reference refidx="95"/><Reference refidx="96"/> A number of cancer syndromes include childhood disease risk, such as retinoblastoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)  types 1 and 2 (MEN1 and MEN2), neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 (NF1 and NF2), Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, Fanconi anemia, FAP, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL).<Reference refidx="97"/><Reference refidx="98"/>    As a consequence, decisions about genetic testing in children are made in the context of a specific gene in which a pathogenic variant is suspected.  The ASCO statement on genetic testing for cancer susceptibility maintains that the decision to consider offering childhood genetic testing should take into account not only the risk of childhood malignancy but also the evidence associated with risk-reduction interventions for that disorder.<Reference refidx="1"/> Specifically, ASCO recommends that:</Para><ItemizedList id="_300" Style="bullet"><ListItem>When screening or preventive strategies during childhood are available (e.g., MEN and FAP), testing should be encouraged on clinical grounds.</ListItem><ListItem>When no risk reduction strategies are available in childhood and the probability of developing a malignancy during childhood is very low (e.g., hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome), testing should not be offered.</ListItem><ListItem>Some patients may be at risk of developing a malignancy during childhood without the availability of validated risk-reduction strategies (e.g., <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> pathogenic variants). The decision to test in such circumstances is particularly controversial.<Reference refidx="1"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_301">Special considerations are required when genetic counseling and testing for pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes are considered in children.  The first issue is the age of the child.  Young children, especially those younger than 10 years, may not be involved or may have limited involvement in the decision to be tested, and some may not participate in the genetic counseling process.  In these cases, the child’s parents or other legal surrogate will be involved in the genetic counseling and will ultimately be responsible for making the decision to proceed with testing.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="99"/> Counseling under these circumstances incorporates a discussion of how test results will be shared with the child when he or she is older.<Reference refidx="1"/> Children aged 10 to 17 years may have more involvement in the decision-making process.<Reference refidx="100"/> In a qualitative study of parents and children aged 10 to 17 years assessing decision making for genetic research participation, older, more mature children and families with open communication styles were more likely to have joint decision making.  Most children in this study felt that they should have the right to make the final decision for genetic research participation, although many would seek input from their parents.<Reference refidx="100"/> While this study is specific to genetic research participation, the findings allude to the importance children aged 10 to 17 years place on personal decision making regarding factors that impact them.  Unfortunately cognitive and psychosocial development may not consistently correlate with the age of the child.<Reference refidx="99"/> Therefore, careful assessment of the child’s developmental stage may help in the genetic counseling and testing process to facilitate parent and child adaptation to the test results.  Another complicating factor includes potential risks of discrimination. For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865#_1787" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/risk-assessment-hp-pdq">Employment and Insurance Discrimination</SummaryRef> section.</Para><Para id="_302">The consequences of genetic testing in children have been reviewed.<Reference refidx="99"/>  In contrast to observations in adults, young children in particular are vulnerable to changes in parent and child bonding based on test results.  Genetic testing could interfere with the development of self-concept and self-esteem.  Children may also be at risk of developing feelings of survivor guilt or heightened anxiety.  All children are especially susceptible to not understanding the testing, results, or implications for their health.  As children mature, they begin to have decreased dependency on their parents while developing their personal identity. This can be altered in the setting of a serious health condition or an inherited disorder.  Older children are beginning to mature physically and develop intimate relationships while also changing their idealized view of their parents.  All of this can be influenced by the results of a genetic test.<Reference refidx="99"/> In its recommendations for genetic testing in asymptomatic minors, the European Society of Human Genetics emphasizes that parents have a responsibility to inform their children about their genetic risk and to communicate this information in a way that is tailored to the child’s age and developmental level.<Reference refidx="101"/><Reference refidx="102"/></Para><Para id="_303"> In summary, genetic testing may be considered in children if the results may alter the child's medical treatment and positively impact his/her health outcomes. Deferral of genetic testing is suggested when the risk of childhood malignancy is low or absent and/or there is no evidence that interventions can reduce risk.<Reference refidx="1"/>  When genetic testing is offered to a child, the child’s developmental stage is used to determine his/her involvement and who has legal authority to provide consent.   It is important for providers to understand a family's psychosocial state and dynamics regarding potential genetic test results; this will enable the provider to give appropriate support when disclosing the child's genetic test result.</Para><Para id="_1921">For more information about testing children for hereditary cancer syndromes, see the following summaries:</Para><ItemizedList id="_1920" Style="bullet"> <ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062855#_972" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq">Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_189" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Genetics of Colorectal Cancer</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000813377" url="/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/men2-hp-pdq">Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2</SummaryRef></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_235"><Title>Testing in vulnerable populations</Title><Para id="_236">Genetic counseling and testing require special considerations when used in vulnerable populations.  In 1995, the American Society of Human Genetics published a position statement on the ethical, legal, and psychosocial implications of genetic testing in children and adolescents as a vulnerable population.<Reference refidx="95"/>  However, vulnerable populations encompass more than just children.  Federal policy applicable to research involving human subjects, <ExternalRef xref="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">45 CFR Code of Federal Regulations part 46 Protection Of Human Subjects</ExternalRef>, considers the following groups as potentially vulnerable populations: prisoners, traumatized and comatose patients, terminally ill patients, older individuals who are cognitively impaired and/or institutionalized, ethnic minorities, students, employees, and individuals from outside the United States.  Specific to genetic testing, the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.isong.org/resources/Documents/PS_Genetic_Counseling.pdf">International Society of Nurses in Genetics</ExternalRef> further expanded the definition of vulnerable populations to also include individuals with hearing and language deficits or conditions limiting communication (for example, language differences and concerns with reliable translation), cognitive impairment, psychiatric disturbances, clients undergoing stress due to a family situation, those without financial resources, clients with acute or chronic illness and in end-of-life, and those in whom medication may impair reasoning.   </Para><Para id="_299">Genetic counseling and testing in vulnerable populations raise special considerations.  The aim of genetic counseling is to help people understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease, which in part involves the meaningful exchange of factual information.<Reference refidx="103"/>  In a vulnerable population, health care providers need to be sensitive to factors that can impact the ability of the individual to comprehend the information.  In particular, in circumstances of cognitive impairment or intellectual disability, special attention is paid to whether the individual’s legally authorized representative should be involved in the counseling, informed consent, and testing process.  </Para><Para id="_351">Providers need to assess all patients for their ability to make an uncoerced, autonomous, informed decision before proceeding with genetic testing.  Populations that do not seem vulnerable (e.g., legally adult college students) may actually be deemed vulnerable because of undue coercion for testing by their parents or the threat of withholding financial support by their parents based on a testing decision inconsistent with the parent’s wishes.  Alteration of the genetic counseling and testing process may be necessary depending on the situation, such as counseling and testing in terminally ill individuals who opt for testing for the benefit of their children, but given their impending death, results may have no impact on their own health care or may not be available before their death.  In summary, genetic counseling and testing requires that the health care provider assess all individuals for any evidence of vulnerability, and if present, be sensitive to those issues, modify genetic counseling based on the specific circumstances, and avoid causing additional harm.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1609"><Title>Cascade Genetic Testing of Family Members</Title><Para id="_1674">In <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000799496" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">cascade genetic testing</GlossaryTermRef>,  biological family members at risk of inheriting a familial pathogenic variant (previously identified in a relative) are offered genetic testing.

There were no significant differences in the genetic test result dissemination rates between intervention (n = 137) and control groups (n = 112).<Reference refidx="122"/></Para><Para id="_1692">A Dutch research group explored using a two-phased telephone motivational-interview intervention conducted by five trained psychosocial workers. Consultands (n = 144) had at least one relative eligible for cascade genetic testing or cancer screening. Phase 1 determined the agenda, confirmed which family members needed to be informed by the consultand, and explored current/planned result-sharing options. Phase 2 focused on sharing certain information, building motivation and self-efficacy in the consultand, and brainstorming ways to overcome dissemination barriers. Consultands found this strategy to be feasible and acceptable. A randomized study will evaluate whether this intervention increases genetic test result  dissemination.<Reference refidx="123"/></Para><Para id="_1693">An Australian randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of telephone genetic counseling in individuals who were diagnosed with genetic conditions, individuals who  had children with genetic conditions, or individuals who were pathogenic variant  carriers. Telephone counseling occurred 2 to 3 times (over 12 months) in the intervention group (n = 45). These individuals were compared with those in the control group (n = 50).

Probands were emailed information about the family testing program. Those interested (n = 1,101) identified at-risk FDRs and provided their contact information. The laboratory sent emails to FDRs, inviting them to test using the same 30-gene panel (which included the pathogenic variants found in their relatives). After 1 year of follow-up, 48% of FDRs underwent genetic testing. Only 12% of FDRs who tested positive continued cascade testing of their own FDRs. Notably, 5% of FDRs had pathogenic variants in genes that differed from those found in their family members.

Many of the issues discussed in a counseling session may need to be revisited as new information emerges. At the end of the counseling process, individuals are typically reminded of the possibility that future research may provide new options and/or new information on risk. Individuals may be advised to check in with the health care provider periodically to determine whether new information is sufficient to merit an additional counseling session. The obligation of health care providers to recontact individuals when new genetic testing or treatment options are available is controversial, and standards have not been established.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><SummarySection id="_354"><Title>Methods of Risk Presentation</Title><Para id="_355">Using probability to communicate risk may overestimate risk certainty; this is especially true when risk estimates have wide confidence intervals or when the patient has characteristics that differ greatly from that of the sample that the risk estimate was based on.  Finally, there are wide variations  in individuals’ level of understanding of mathematical concepts (i.e., numeracy).  For all the above reasons, conveying risk in multiple ways, both numerically and verbally, with discussion of important caveats, may be a useful strategy to increase risk comprehension.  The numerical format that facilitates the best understanding is natural frequencies because frequencies include information concerning the denominator, the reference group to which the individual may refer.  In general, logarithmic scales are to be avoided.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Additionally, important “contextual” risks may be included with the frequency in order to increase risk comprehension; these may include how the person’s risk compares with those who do not have the risk factor in question and the risks associated with common hazards, such as being in a car accident.  Additional suggestions include being consistent in risk formats (do not mix odds and percentages), using the same denominator across risk estimates, avoiding decimal points, including base rate information, and providing more explanation if the risk is less than 1%.</Para><Para id="_356">The communication of risk may be numerical or visual. Use of multiple strategies may increase comprehension and retention of cancer genetic risk information.<Reference refidx="4"/> Recently, use of visual risk communication strategies has increased (e.g., histograms, pie charts, and Venn diagrams).  Visual depictions of risk may be very useful when working with visual learners, but research that confirms this is lacking.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> A  study published in 2008 examined the use of two different visual aids to communicate breast cancer risk. Women at an increased risk of breast cancer were randomized to receive feedback via a bar graph alone or a bar graph plus a frequency diagram (i.e., highlighted human figures). Overall results indicated that  there were no differences in improved accuracy of risk perception between the two groups. However, there was a greater improvement in accuracy of risk perception among the group of women who inaccurately perceived very high risk at baseline and received both visual aids.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_218"><Title>Communication Strategies</Title><Para id="_357">Studies have examined novel channels to communicate genetic cancer risk information, deliver psychosocial support, and  standardize the genetic counseling process for individuals at increased risk of cancer.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/>   Much of this literature has attempted to make the genetic counseling session more efficient or to limit the need for the counselor to address basic genetic principles in the session to free up time for the client’s personal and emotional concerns about his or her risk.  For example, the receipt of genetic feedback for <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> and mismatch repair gene testing by letter, rather than a face-to-face genetic counseling feedback session, has been investigated.<Reference refidx="16"/>   Other modalities include the development of patient assessments or checklists, CD-ROM programs, and interactive computer programs.  </Para><Para id="_1248">A prospective study evaluated the effects of a CD-ROM decisional support aid for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285933" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">microsatellite instability</GlossaryTermRef> (MSI) tumor testing  in 239 colorectal cancer patients who met the revised Bethesda criteria  but who did not meet the Amsterdam criteria.<Reference refidx="17"/> The study also tested a theoretical model of factors influencing decisional conflict surrounding decisions to pursue MSI tumor testing. Within the study, half of the sample was randomly assigned to receive a brief description of MSI testing within the clinical encounter, and the other half was provided the CD-ROM decisional support aid in addition to the brief description.  The CD-ROM and brief description intervention increased knowledge about MSI testing more than the brief description alone did. As a result, participants felt more prepared to make a decision about the test and had increased perceived benefits of MSI testing. </Para><Para id="_358">Other innovative strategies include educational materials and interactive computer technology.  In one study, a 13-page color communication aid using a diverse format for conveying risk, including graphic representations and verbal descriptions, was developed.<Reference refidx="11"/> The authors evaluated the influence of the communication aid in 27 women who were at high risk of having a <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> pathogenic variant. They compared these women with a sample of 107 women who received standard genetic counseling.  Improvements in genetic knowledge and accuracy of risk perception were documented in those who had read the aid. There were no differences in anxiety or depression between groups.     Personalized, interactive electronic  materials have also been developed to aid in genetic education and counseling.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>  In one study,  an interactive computer education program available prior to the genetic counseling session was compared with genetic counseling alone in women undergoing counseling for <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> testing.<Reference refidx="13"/> Use of the computer program prior to genetic counseling reduced face-time with the genetic counselor, particularly for those at lower risk of a <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> pathogenic variant.  Many of the counselors reported that their client’s use of the computer program allowed them to be more efficient and to reallocate time spent in the sessions to clients’ unique concerns.</Para><Para id="_359">Videoconferencing is an innovative strategy to facilitate genetic counseling sessions with clients who cannot travel to specialized clinic settings.  In 37 individuals in the United Kingdom, real-time video conferencing was compared with face-to-face counseling sessions; both methods were found to improve knowledge and reduce anxiety levels.<Reference refidx="14"/>  Similarly, teleconferencing sessions, in which the client and genetic specialists talked with each other in real time, were used in rural Maine communities <Reference refidx="15"/> for pediatric genetic consults. These sessions were used to convey genetic information and developmental delays. These sessions resulted in comparable decision-making confidence and session satisfaction when contrasted with in-person consultations. An Australian study compared  the experiences of 106 women who received hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) genetic counseling via videoconferencing with the experiences of   89 women who received counseling face to face.  Pre- and 1-month postcounseling assessments revealed no significant differences in knowledge gains, satisfaction, cancer-specific anxiety,  generalized anxiety, depression, and perceived empathy of the genetic counselor.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_122"><Title>Posttest Education and Result Notification</Title><Para id="_126">Posttest counseling may include consideration of the implications of the test
results for other family members.  It has been suggested that some individuals <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460124" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">affected</GlossaryTermRef> by an inherited disorder agree to have genetic testing performed in order to acquire information that could be shared with family members. There is evidence that implementation of a follow-up counseling program with the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460211" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">proband</GlossaryTermRef>, after test results are revealed, will significantly increase the proportion of relatives informed of their genetic risk. Follow-up counseling may include telephone conversations with the proband verifying which family members have been contacted and an offer to assist with conveying information to family members.<Reference refidx="19"/> Some experts have suggested that if a test
result is positive, plans should be made at this time for the notification, education,
and counseling of other relatives based on the test result of the individual.
Written materials, brochures, or personal letters may aid people in informing
the appropriate relatives about genetic risk.
</Para><Para id="_127">When a test result is negative, the posttest session may be briefer.  It is important, however, to discuss genetic, medical, and psychological implications of
a negative result in a family with a known pathogenic variant.  For example, it
is essential that the person understand that the general population risks for
relevant cancer types still apply; additionally, the person’s individual risk of cancer
may still be influenced by other risk factors and family history from
the other side of the person's family.  Furthermore, people may feel
distress even when a test is negative.  This outcome has been documented in the context of <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> pathogenic variant testing <Reference refidx="20"/> and may also be anticipated in other cancer
susceptibility testing.  Posttest results discussion of such distress may
lead to referral for additional counseling in some cases.
</Para><Para id="_128">Many individuals benefit from follow-up counseling and consultation with medical specialists after
disclosure of genetic test results. This provides an opportunity for further discussion of
feelings about their risk statuses, options for risk management (including screening and detection procedures), and implications of the test
results for other family members.  
For example, a standard-of-care randomized controlled trial of 100 female <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>/<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> carriers found positive psychological outcomes and improved sleep quality in those who participated in the 12-week Inquiry-Based Stress Reduction (IBSR) intervention.

Knowledge and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., distress) were found to be noninferior, equivalent, or not statistically significant between telephone counseling and in-person counseling. Two studies demonstrated lower testing intention or uptake among participants who received telephone counseling. The majority of studies also found no difference in satisfaction; however, two studies demonstrated higher satisfaction among individuals who received telephone compared with those who received in-person genetic counseling.<Reference refidx="14"/> A subsequent study examined several dimensions of patient perceptions of genetic counseling among participants of a randomized trial of telephone versus in-person genetic counseling.<Reference refidx="15"/> In the 2-week period after their pretest genetic counseling appointment, participants who had telephone-based counseling were more likely to rate it as convenient; however, they also reported lower levels of support and emotional recognition by the counselor. There were no differences in overall satisfaction.  Exploratory analysis demonstrated that racial and ethnic minority participants reported lower perceptions of counselor support with in-person counseling when compared with telephone counseling. The opposite was observed for non-Hispanic White participants. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings given the small sample size.

In this trial, telephone disclosure was noninferior to in-person results disclosure when comparing primary psychosocial outcomes (e.g., general and state anxiety). In primary analysis, knowledge did not meet the threshold of noninferiority without imputing missing data.

Additionally, with the passage of GINA, researchers and clinicians can encourage participation in clinical trials and appropriate genetic testing knowing that there are federal protections against discrimination based on the results of genetic testing. GINA established the minimum protection level that must be met in all states. However, for states with more robust legislation in place, GINA does not weaken existing protections provided by state law.</Para><Para id="_1796">However, GINA has several limitations, including the following:</Para><OrderedList id="_1091" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>GINA does not apply to members of the United States military, to veterans obtaining health care through the Veteran’s Administration, or to the Indian Health Service because the laws amended by GINA do not apply to these groups and programs.</ListItem><ListItem>The legislation does not apply to life insurance, long-term care insurance, or disability insurance.  Even though GINA does not provide protection for employer-provided disability and life insurance, some states do encompass these arenas in addition to employment, genetic privacy, health insurance, health insurance enforcement, life, disability, and long-term care. NHGRI's <ExternalRef xref="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/Genome-Statute-Legislation-Database">Genome Statute and Legislation Database</ExternalRef> provides a searchable listing of state statutes and bills related to the following topics: direct-to-consumer genetic testing, employment and insurance nondiscrimination, health insurance coverage, privacy, research, and the use of residual newborn screening specimens.</ListItem><ListItem>GINA’s employment provisions generally do not apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees.<Reference refidx="68"/></ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_1797">Under GINA, it is permissible for employers to request employees' genetic information for the purposes of voluntary wellness programs. However, employers cannot encourage employees to provide their genetic information; this means that if an employee chooses to give genetic information to the wellness program, they cannot receive an additional reward for doing so. Conversely, if an employee chooses to withhold genetic information, they cannot be penalized.<Reference refidx="65"/>  Regulations regarding workplace wellness programs have been amended by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and they are in the process of further revision.<Reference refidx="71"/>  Thus, before providing genetic information to such wellness programs, patients should be informed about current regulations and provisions for privacy and confidentiality. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1798"><Title>Exception to protections against employment and insurance discrimination: Military personnel</Title><Para id="_1799">GINA and other state and federal protections do not extend to genetic testing of active duty military personnel or genetic information obtained from active duty military personnel.<Reference refidx="72"/>   In the military, genetic testing provides medical information that is to be used to protect military personnel from potentially harmful duties or exposures that could stimulate or aggravate a health problem. For example, use of certain antimalaria medications in individuals with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can result in red blood cell rupture. Therefore, some genetic information may be critical for maintaining the health and safety of military personnel, given the possible stressful occupational environments they may face.
