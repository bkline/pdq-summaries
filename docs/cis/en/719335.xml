On the basis of data from  2018 to 2021, it is estimated that  12.8% of U.S. men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetimes.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_50">Many studies suggest that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044964" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">complementary and alternative medicine</GlossaryTermRef> (CAM) use is common among prostate cancer patients, and the use of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044744" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">vitamins</GlossaryTermRef>, supplements, and specific foods is frequently reported by these patients.  For example, the Prostate CAncer Therapy Selection (PCATS) study was a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044079" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">prospective</GlossaryTermRef> study that investigated men’s decision-making processes about treatment following a diagnosis of local-<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">stage</GlossaryTermRef> prostate cancer. As part of this study, patients completed surveys regarding CAM use, and more than half of the respondents reported using one or more CAM therapies, with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000729732" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">mind-body modalities</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044510" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">biologically</GlossaryTermRef> based treatments being the most commonly used.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_51">International studies have reported similar findings. A Swedish study published in 2011 found that, overall, participants with prostate cancer were more likely to have used supplements than were healthy population-based <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">control subjects</GlossaryTermRef>. Supplement use was even more common among patients with the healthiest dietary patterns (e.g., high consumption of fatty fish and vegetables).<Reference refidx="3"/>  In a Canadian study, CAM use was reported among 39% of recently diagnosed prostate cancer patients, and the most commonly used forms of CAM were <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463714" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">herbals</GlossaryTermRef>, vitamins, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045787" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">minerals</GlossaryTermRef>.

The two most popular reasons for choosing CAM  were to boost the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> and to prevent <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045861" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">recurrence</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="4"/>  According to another Canadian study, approximately 30% of survey respondents with prostate cancer reported using CAM treatments. In that study,  vitamin E, saw palmetto, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044909" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">lycopene</GlossaryTermRef> were most commonly used.<Reference refidx="5"/>     A British study published in 2008 indicated that 25% of prostate cancer patients used CAM, with the most frequently reported interventions being low-fat <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">diets</GlossaryTermRef>, vitamins, and lycopene.

One study examined vitamin and supplement use in men with a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000642015" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">family history</GlossaryTermRef> of prostate cancer. At the time of the survey, almost 60% of the men were using vitamins or supplements. One-third of the men were using vitamins and supplements that were specifically marketed for prostate health or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045487" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">chemoprevention</GlossaryTermRef> (e.g., selenium, green tea, and saw palmetto).<Reference refidx="7"/> A 2004 study examined herbal and vitamin supplement use in men who attended a prostate cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046171" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">screening</GlossaryTermRef> clinic. Men who attended the screening clinic completed questionnaires about supplement use. Of the respondents, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390238" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">analysis</GlossaryTermRef> revealed that a reported 70% used multivitamins, and 21% used herbal supplements.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_53">A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000691484" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">meta-analysis</GlossaryTermRef> published in 2008 reviewed studies that reported vitamin and mineral supplement use among cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450125" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">survivors</GlossaryTermRef>.

A qualitative study published in 2005 described results from interviews with prostate cancer patients. The study identified differences in thinking patterns between CAM users and nonusers and suggested that no specific theme led patients to CAM; instead, patients were directed by a combination of ideas. For example, the perception of CAM as harmless was associated with the belief that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449752" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">conventional medicine</GlossaryTermRef> resulted in many negative <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">side effects</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Results of a 2003 qualitative study suggested that decision making about CAM treatments by prostate cancer patients depended on both fixed (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000689078" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">medical history</GlossaryTermRef>) and flexible (e.g., a need to feel in control) decision factors.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_577">Many of the medical and scientific terms used in this summary are hypertext linked (at first use in each section) to the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/">NCI Dictionary                   of Cancer Terms</ExternalRef>, which is oriented toward nonexperts.

Most studies have examined the association of lycopene intake with the risk of all prostate cancers and have not separately considered indolent versus aggressive disease.

The end-of-study prostate lycopene concentration was 0.16 nmol/g (standard error of the mean, 0.02) in the controls, but was 3.5-, 3.6- and 2.2-fold higher in tomato soup (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .001), sauce (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .001), and juice (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .165) consumers, respectively. Prostate lycopene concentration was moderately correlated with postintervention plasma lycopene concentrations (correlation coefficient, 0.60; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .001), indicating that additional factors have an impact on tissue concentrations. While the primary geometric lycopene isomer in tomato products was all-trans (80%–90%), plasma and prostate isomers were 47% and 80% <Emphasis>cis</Emphasis>-lycopene, respectively, demonstrating a shift towards cis accumulation. Consumption of typical servings of processed tomato products results in differing plasma and prostate lycopene concentrations.

Thirty healthy men aged 50 to 70 years were randomly assigned to two groups, with each group consuming  200 g/d of yellow tomato paste (lycopene, 0 mg) and 200 g/d of red tomato paste (lycopene, 16 mg) as part of their regular diet for 1 week, separated by a 2-week washout period. Then, in a parallel design, the first group underwent supplementation with purified lycopene (16 mg/d) for 1 week, and the second group received a placebo. Sera samples collected before and after the interventions were incubated with lymph node cancer prostate cells to measure the expression of 45 target genes. In this placebo-controlled trial, circulating  lycopene concentration increased only after consumption of red tomato paste and purified lycopene. Lipid profile, antioxidant status, PSA, and IGF-1 were not modified by consumption of tomato pastes and lycopene. When prostate cancer cells were treated <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> with sera collected from men after red tomato paste consumption, IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and the ratio of Bax to Bcl2 were up-regulated, and cyclin-D1, p53, and Nrf-2 were down-regulated compared with expression levels obtained using sera taken after the first washout period. Intermediate gene expression changes were observed using sera collected from participants after consumption of yellow tomato paste with low carotenoid content. Cell incubation with sera from men who consumed purified lycopene led to significant up-regulation of IGFBP-3, c-fos, and uPAR compared with sera collected after placebo consumption.

Prostate cancer cells were treated with three different pectins; CP, Pectasol (PeS, a dietary supplement containing MCP), and fractionated pectin powder (FPP). FPP induced apoptosis to a much greater degree than did CP and PeS.

The incidence of prostate cancer was also higher in men who took selenium than in men who took placebo, but the differences were not statistically significant.<Reference refidx="39"/></Para><Para id="_834">A number of explanations have been suggested, including the dose and form of vitamin E used in the trial and the specific form of selenium chosen for the study. L-selenomethionine was used in SELECT, while selenite and Se-yeast had been used in previous studies. SELECT researchers chose selenomethionine because it was the major component of Se-yeast and because selenite was not absorbed well by the body, resulting in lower selenium stores.<Reference refidx="40"/> In addition, there were concerns about product consistency with high–Se-yeast.<Reference refidx="41"/> However, selenomethionine is involved in general protein synthesis and can have numerous metabolites such as methylselenol, which may have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446109" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">antitumor</GlossaryTermRef> properties.<Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/></Para><Para id="_835">Toenail selenium concentrations were examined in two-case cohort subset studies of SELECT participants. Total selenium concentration in the absence of supplementation was not associated with prostate cancer risk. Although selenium supplementation in SELECT had no effect on prostate cancer risk among men with low selenium status at baseline, it increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer in men with higher baseline selenium status by 91% (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .007). The authors concluded that men should avoid selenium supplementation at doses exceeding recommended dietary intakes.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para><Para id="_836">Complicating this picture, an international collaboration compiled and reanalyzed data from 15 studies, including the SELECT trial, that investigated the association between blood and toenail selenium concentrations and prostate cancer risk.<Reference refidx="45"/> In the analysis of 6,497 men with prostate cancer and 8,107 controls, blood selenium level was not associated with the risk of total prostate cancer, but high blood selenium level was associated with a lower risk of aggressive disease. Toenail selenium concentration was inversely associated with risk of total prostate cancer (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000618610" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">odds ratio</GlossaryTermRef>, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.22–0.40; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis><Subscript>trend</Subscript> &lt; .001), including both aggressive and nonaggressive disease.</Para><Para id="_837">In a case-cohort analysis of the SELECT trial, 1,434 men underwent analysis of SNPs in 21 genes, investigators found support for the hypothesis that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000776887" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">genetic variation</GlossaryTermRef> in selenium and vitamin E metabolism/transport genes may influence the risk of overall and high-grade prostate cancer;  selenium or vitamin E supplementation may modify an individual's response to those risks.<Reference refidx="46"/></Para><Para id="_838">In summary, data from the SELECT trial did not provide evidence that selenium, when given to unselected populations, decreased the risk of prostate cancer. Subsequent analyses have shown that baseline selenium levels may influence the outcomes of selenium supplementation, though the evidence remains conflicting. Emerging evidence suggests that SNPs in genes related to both selenium and prostate cancer likely modify the effect of selenium supplementation. Further research is needed to better understand which patients may benefit from or be harmed by selenium supplementation.</Para></SummarySection><Para id="_839">To date, the most recent literature demonstrates that when administered to a non-selected population, selenium has no significant effect on either prostate cancer prevention or PSA levels.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_826"><Title>Treatment</Title><Para id="_827">A study explored the potential role of selenium in prostate cancer patients on <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000616060" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">active surveillance</GlossaryTermRef>.

In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef> (FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease prevention or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).

The FDA can remove dietary supplements from the market that are deemed unsafe.  Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts).

In one study, human prostate cancer cells and normal prostate <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045682" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">epithelial</GlossaryTermRef> cells were treated with either an ethanol vehicle (carrier) or isoflavones. Treatment with genistein decreased COX-2 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000662001" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">mRNA</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">protein</GlossaryTermRef> levels in cancer cells and normal epithelial cells more than did treatment with the vehicle. In addition, cells treated with genistein exhibited reduced <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000643082" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">secretion</GlossaryTermRef> of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and reduced mRNA levels of the prostaglandin <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044958" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">receptors</GlossaryTermRef> EP4 and FP, suggesting that genistein may exert <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045487" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">chemopreventive</GlossaryTermRef> effects by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, which promote <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044042" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">inflammation</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="10"/>  In another study, human prostate cancer cells were treated with genistein or daidzein.

However, during the 72 hours of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045734" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">incubation</GlossaryTermRef>, only genistein provoked effects on the dynamic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460203" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">phenotype</GlossaryTermRef> and decreased invasiveness in PC-3 cells. These results imply that invasive activity is at least partially dependent on <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046294" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">membrane</GlossaryTermRef> fluidity and that genistein may exert its antimetastatic effects by changing the mechanical properties of prostate cancer cells.

In one study, human prostate cancer cells were treated with a soy <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000407760" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">extract</GlossaryTermRef> (containing genistin, daidzein, and glycitin), genistein, or daidzein. The soy extract induced <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000597111" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">cell cycle</GlossaryTermRef> arrest and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046524" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">apoptosis</GlossaryTermRef> in prostate cancer cells to a greater degree  than did treatment with the individual isoflavones. Genistein and daidzein activated apoptosis in noncancerous <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046509" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">benign prostatic hyperplasia</GlossaryTermRef> (BPH) cells, but the soy extract had no effect on those cells. These findings suggested that products  containing a combination of active <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000422394" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">compounds</GlossaryTermRef> (e.g., <Emphasis>whole foods</Emphasis>) may be more effective in preventing cancer than individual compounds.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Similarly, in another study, prostate cancer cells were treated with genistein, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044148" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">biochanin A</GlossaryTermRef>, quercetin, doublets of those compounds (e.g., genistein + quercetin), or with all three compounds. All of the treatments resulted in decreased cell proliferation, but the greatest reductions occurred using the combination of genistein, biochanin A, and quercetin. The triple combination treatment induced more apoptosis in prostate cancer cells than did individual or doublet compound treatments. These results indicate that combining phytoestrogens may increase the effectiveness of the individual compounds.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_116">At least one study has examined the combined effect of soy isoflavones and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046049" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">curcumin</GlossaryTermRef>.

The TRAMP mice fed with genistein exhibited reduced cell proliferation in the prostate compared with TRAMP mice fed a control diet. The genistein-supplemented diet also reduced levels of ERK-1 and ERK-2 (proteins important in stimulating cell proliferation) as well as the growth factor receptors epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in TRAMP mice, suggesting that down regulation of these proteins may be one mechanism by which genistein exerts chemopreventive effects.<Reference refidx="16"/>  In one study, following the appearance of spontaneous <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044345" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046324" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">lesions</GlossaryTermRef>, TRAMP mice were fed control diets or diets supplemented with genistein (250 or 1,000 mg genistein/kg chow). Mice fed low-dose genistein exhibited more cancer cell metastasis and greater osteopontin expression than mice fed the control or the high-dose genistein diet. These results indicate that timing and dose of genistein treatment may affect prostate cancer outcomes and that genistein may exert biphasic control over prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_733">  In a  study reported in 2008, athymic mice were implanted with human prostate cancer cells and fed a control or genistein-supplemented diet (100 or 250 mg genistein/kg chow). Mice that were fed genistein exhibited less cancer  cell metastasis but no change in primary tumor volume, compared with mice fed a control diet. Furthermore, other data suggested that genistein  inhibits metastasis by impairing cancer cell detachment.<Reference refidx="18"/>  </Para><Para id="_734">In contrast, in a study reported in 2011, there were more metastases in secondary <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257523" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">organs</GlossaryTermRef> in genistein-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice.

In addition, there was a reduction in tumor cell apoptosis in the genistein-treated mice compared with the vehicle-treated mice.

Mixed isoflavones were more effective than genistein in inhibiting prostate tumor growth, and combining isoflavones with radiation resulted in the largest inhibition of tumor growth. In addition, mice given soy isoflavones in combination with radiation did not exhibit <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045762" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">lymph node</GlossaryTermRef> metastasis, which was seen previously in other experiments combining genistein with radiation.
