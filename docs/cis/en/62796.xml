oncology.  These may include total mortality (or survival from the initiation
of therapy), cause-specific mortality, quality of life, or indirect surrogates
such as event-free survival, disease-free survival, progression-free
survival, or tumor response rate.  End points may also be determined within
study designs of varying strength, ranging from the gold standard—the
randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial—to case series
experiences from nonconsecutive patients.  </Para><Para id="_66">The PDQ editorial boards use a
formal ranking system of levels of evidence to help the reader judge the
strength of evidence linked to the reported results of a therapeutic strategy. 
For any given therapy, results can be ranked on each of the following two
scales: (1) <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062796#_33" url="/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/treatment">strength of the study design</SummaryRef> and (2) <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062796#_43" url="/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/treatment">strength of the study end points</SummaryRef>. 
Together, the two rankings inform the overall level of evidence. 
Depending on perspective, different expert panels, professional organizations,
or individual physicians may use different cut points of overall strength of
evidence in formulating therapeutic guidelines or in taking action. However,
a formal description of the level of evidence provides a uniform framework for
the data, leading to specific recommendations.</Para><Para id="_32">The <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment">PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board</ExternalRef> and the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment">PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board</ExternalRef> add information on levels of evidence,
described below, to the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/adult-treatment">PDQ Adult Cancer Treatment Summaries</ExternalRef> and the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/pediatric-treatment">PDQ Pediatric Cancer Treatment Summaries</ExternalRef>  when appropriate.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_33"><Title>Strength of Study Design</Title><Para id="_34">The various types of study design are described below in descending order of strength:</Para><OrderedList id="_35" Style="Arabic"><ListItem><Strong>Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs).</Strong><Para id="_37">The double-blinded RCT is the gold standard of study design.  To meet this designation, the study
allocation must be blinded to the physician both before and after
the randomization and treatment assignment take place.  This design provides
protection from allocation bias by the investigator and from bias in
assessment of outcomes by both the investigator and the patient. 
Unfortunately, most clinical trials in oncology cannot be double-blinded
after treatment allocation because procedures or toxic effects often vary
substantially among study allocations in ways that are obvious to both
the health care professional and the patient.
</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Meta-analyses of RCTs.</Strong><Para id="_67">Meta-analyses of randomized studies offer a quantitative synthesis of
previously conducted studies.  The strength of evidence from a
meta-analysis is based on the quality of the conduct of individual
studies.  Moreover, meta-analyses can magnify small systematic errors in
individual studies.  A study comparing the results of single, large, randomized
trials with those of meta-analyses of smaller trials published earlier on 
the same topics showed only fair agreement (kappa statistic, 0.35).  Outcomes
of the large RCTs were not predicted accurately by
the meta-analysis 35% of the time.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  Meta-analyses performed by different
investigators to address the same clinical issue can reach contradictory
conclusions.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Therefore, meta-analyses of randomized studies are placed in
the same or lower category of strength of evidence as randomized studies, not at a
higher level.</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Nonrandomized controlled clinical trials.</Strong><Para id="_40">This category includes trials in which treatment allocation was
nonrandomized and prospective. The allocation would be known
to the investigator before informed consent is obtained from the patient. 
An imbalance can occur in treatment
allocation under such circumstances.  Subset
analyses within randomized trials often fall into this category of
evidence.</Para><Para id="_68">Subset analyses of randomized studies are subject to errors inherent in
multiplicity (i.e., statistically significant results are to be expected because of random variation of measured effects in multiple subsets). 
Therefore, subset analyses do not represent the same strength of evidence
as the overall analysis of a randomized trial as designed unless explicit
prospective hypotheses are made for the analyzed subset.  Subset analyses should be placed in the next lower category of study design,
nonrandomized controlled clinical trials.</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Case series or other observational study designs.</Strong><Para id="_42">These clinical experiences are the weakest form of study
design, but they may be the only available or practical information in
support of a therapeutic strategy. This is especially true in the case of rare
diseases or when the evolution of the therapy predates the common use of
randomized study designs in medical practice.  Case series or observational designs may also provide the only
practical design when treatments in study arms are radically different
(e.g., amputation vs. limb-sparing surgery).  Nevertheless, they always raise issues of
patient selection and comparability with other populations.  In terms of
generalizability to other populations, the strongest to weakest study designs are the following: population-based studies that have a definable population,
nonpopulation-based but consecutive series, and nonconsecutive cases.
Some study designs (e.g., cohort and case-control studies) have internal-control study subjects, while others do not (e.g., case-only series with no internal comparison group or case-only series that are compared with historical controls).</Para><Para id="_63">Even large, population-based, observational studies with internal controls that compare therapeutic strategies in oncology should be interpreted with extreme caution.  In a study that directly compared observational studies with RCT results, investigators performed a systematic MEDLINE search for observational studies published from 2000 to 2016 using data from  the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, SEER-Medicare, or the National Cancer Database that compared treatment regimens for any diagnosis of cancer.<Reference refidx="3"/>  The investigators matched 350 treatment comparisons to 121 RCTs that made the same comparison.  They found no significant correlation between the hazard ratios (HRs) of the observational studies and the matching RCTs (concordance correlation coefficient, 0.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.07 to 0.23).  Only 40% of matched studies agreed with respect to treatment effects (kappa statistic, 0.037), and only 62% of the HRs in observational studies were within the 95% CI of the matched RCT.  None of these correlations exceeded what would be expected by chance, and correlations did not improve in the studies that used the most sophisticated statistical methods of analysis, including propensity score weighting, instrumental variable adjustment, or sensitivity analysis.  Of note, among the 70 observational studies ranked as rigorous and that reported overall survival, 35 reported a positive result, while the RCT reported either no difference or showed an effect in the opposite direction.</Para></ListItem></OrderedList><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="9262498" MedlineID="97390204">LeLorier J, Grégoire G, Benhaddad A, et al.: Discrepancies between meta-analyses and subsequent large randomized, controlled trials.
