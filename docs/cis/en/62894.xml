often be cured if it is diagnosed and treated when still localized to the
kidney and the immediately surrounding tissue.  The probability of cure is
directly related to the stage or degree of tumor dissemination.  Even when
regional lymphatics or blood vessels are involved with the tumor, a significant
number of patients can achieve prolonged survival and probable cure.<Reference refidx="2"/>  When
distant metastases are present, disease-free survival is poor; however, 
some patients survive after surgical resection of all known
tumor.  Because most patients are diagnosed when the tumor is still
relatively localized and amenable to surgical removal, approximately 75% of all
patients with renal cell cancer survive for 5 years.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Occasionally, patients with locally
advanced or metastatic disease may exhibit indolent courses lasting several
years.  Late tumor recurrence many years after initial treatment also occasionally
occurs.
</Para><Para id="_3">Renal cell cancer is one of the few tumors in which well-documented cases of
spontaneous tumor regression in the absence of therapy exist, but this regression occurs
rarely and may not lead to long-term survival.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_305"><Title>Treatment Modalities</Title><Para id="_306">Surgical resection is the
mainstay of treatment of this disease.  Even in patients with disseminated
tumor, locoregional forms of therapy may play an important role in palliating
symptoms of the primary tumor or of ectopic hormone production.  Systemic
therapy has demonstrated only limited effectiveness.

of proximal tubular origin.  Most of the remainder are transitional cell
carcinomas of the renal pelvis. For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062937" url="/types/kidney/hp/transitional-cell-treatment-pdq">Transitional Cell
Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter Treatment</SummaryRef>. 
Adenocarcinomas may be separated into clear cell and granular cell carcinomas; however,  the two cell types may occur together in some tumors.  Some
investigators have found that granular cell tumors have a worse prognosis, but
this finding is not universal.  Distinguishing  between well-differentiated
renal adenocarcinomas and renal adenomas can be difficult.  The diagnosis is
usually made arbitrarily based on the size of the mass, but size alone
should not influence the treatment approach because metastases can occur with
lesions as small as 0.5 cm.

prognostic sign if the tumor is otherwise confined to the substance of the
kidney.  Abnormal liver function test results may be caused by a paraneoplastic
syndrome that is reversible with tumor removal, and these types of results do not necessarily represent
metastatic disease. Except when computed tomography (CT) examination is
equivocal or when iodinated contrast material is contraindicated, CT scanning
is as good as or better than magnetic resonance imaging for detecting
renal masses.<Reference refidx="4"/>
