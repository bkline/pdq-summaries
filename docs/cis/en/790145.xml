In the absence of formal screening, asymptomatic thyroid cancers are most commonly detected incidentally on cross-sectional imaging performed for other medical conditions or on surgical specimens of benign diseases such as goiter.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_26">The efficacy of thyroid cancer screening has never been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).<Reference refidx="2"/> No RCTs of intermediate end points (e.g., changes in stage at diagnosis) have been conducted. No population-based screening programs for thyroid cancer exist in the United States, the United Kingdom, or Europe, although neck palpation screening results in incidental detection of asymptomatic cancers. Over time, U.S. and U.K. thyroid cancer incidence rates have increased, but thyroid cancer mortality has remained constant or decreased slightly.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> That pattern is consistent with the detection of cancers that are not destined to cause symptoms or result in death  (overdiagnosis). </Para><Para id="_27">In South Korea, thyroid cancer screening increased dramatically in conjunction with the 1999 establishment of a free national cancer screening program. Although not offered as part of the package of free screening exams, thyroid cancer screening with ultrasound was offered simultaneously at low cost in most clinics, and many South Koreans opted for the exams.<Reference refidx="5"/> Thyroid cancer incidence in South Korea increased 15-fold from 1993 to 2011, although no change in thyroid cancer mortality occurred concurrently.<Reference refidx="6"/> In 2011, the number of people diagnosed with thyroid cancer (40,000) was more than 100 times higher than the number who died of thyroid cancer (typically 300–400 each year, with little change in mortality rates since 1999).<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> The practice of thyroid cancer screening in South Korea began to wane in 2013 because of concerns about overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In 2015, the Korean Committee for National Cancer Screening Guidelines issued a recommendation against thyroid cancer screening with ultrasonography for healthy individuals.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_28">In 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended against thyroid cancer screening. The Task Force’s conclusion, based on observational evidence, was that “the net benefit of screening for thyroid cancer is negative.”<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="8"/> The American College of Radiology does not recommend screening for thyroid cancer with imaging and, in a white paper, addressed the management of incidental nodules detected on imaging for other medical problems.<Reference refidx="9"/> The American College of Radiology stated that workup was not required for incidental thyroid nodules detected on imaging if nodules were smaller than 1 cm in patients younger than 35 years and smaller than 1.5 cm in patients aged 35 years and older. </Para><Para id="_29">Much of what is known about the impact of thyroid cancer screening comes from South Korea’s experience. Investigators examined thyroid cancer trends in South Korea using the following three data sources:<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_113" Style="bullet"><ListItem> The 2010 Korea Community Health Survey.</ListItem><ListItem>The Korea Cancer Registry.</ListItem><ListItem>Mortality data from Statistics Korea.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_114">The Korea Community Health Survey asked more than 200,000 people whether they had been screened for thyroid cancer in the past 2 years. Thyroid cancer incidence from 2008 to 2010, mortality from 2007 to 2010, and the percent of  people who reported thyroid cancer screening were calculated for each of the 16 administrative units of Korea, and correlations were calculated. The authors identified a strong positive correlation between rates of reported thyroid cancer screening and thyroid cancer incidence in the 16 areas (correlation coefficient [<Emphasis>r</Emphasis>], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70–0.82). The correlation was stronger in women (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis>, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83–0.92) than in men (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis>, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67–0.84). However, there was no correlation between thyroid cancer incidence and mortality (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis>, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.59 to -0.63). Thyroid cancer screening was correlated with increased detection of papillary thyroid cancer (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis>, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59–0.88) and no other histological subtypes.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_30">The South Korean data are limited because they are not experimental; however, they present a compelling argument against thyroid cancer screening in community settings.

The risks of thyroid fine-needle aspiration are hospitalization, postprocedural hematoma, and needle tract tumor implantation, although two observational studies suggest that the rate of each of the three outcomes is lower than 1%.<Reference refidx="1"/> More importantly, the results of cytology can lead to additional tests and surgery. In a meta-analysis of 23,445 nodules  that were biopsied, 60% of the nodules were benign, and 5% of the nodules were malignant. However, the remaining 35% of the nodules required repeat biopsy or surgery.<Reference refidx="3"/> In patients who had a diagnostic lobectomy or excision, 64% of the nodules were benign on final histological evaluation.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_33">Thyroid surgery for benign disease has the same risks as it does for malignancy. In 2013, about 80% of surgeries for small localized papillary thyroid cancers were total thyroidectomies and 20% were lobectomies. However, the 25-year cumulative risk of death caused by thyroid cancer does not differ by type of surgery.<Reference refidx="4"/> Surgical risks are lower for a lobectomy than for total thyroidectomy. In addition to the general risks of surgery, specific risks of thyroid surgery include recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypoparathyroidism. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury causes vocal cord paresis, which can result in difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, and hoarseness. Breathing difficulties are possible if both laryngeal nerves are affected.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> Hypoparathyroidism leads to hypocalcemia. A cross-sectional population-based survey included 2,632 thyroid cancer patients, 2 to 4 years after diagnosis, from two U.S. SEER registries. The study reported that 25.8% of patients had voice changes more than 3 months after surgery, and 4.7% of patients had vocal fold paralysis or paresis.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_115">A meta-analysis of hypoparathyroidism lasting more than 6 months after thyroidectomy produced a summary event measure of 3.57 per 100 procedures (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.12–5.93). Summary event measures were 1.86 per 100 procedures (95% CI, 0.84–4.04) with unilateral lymph node dissection and 3.46 per 100 procedures (95% CI, 1.20–9.56) with bilateral lymph node dissection. In Korea, the trend in the incidence rate of postoperative hypoparathyroidism paralleled that of the incidence rate of thyroid cancer, increasing from 2.6 per 100,000 in 2007 to 7.3 per 100,000 in 2012.<Reference refidx="8"/> Event measures from individual studies were quite variable and, in most instances, were based on very small numbers of events; however, summary measures did not vary much by extent of thyroid or lymph node resection.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_116">A meta-analysis of laryngeal nerve palsy (a cause of unilateral vocal cord paralysis and hoarseness) lasting more than 6 months produced a summary event measure of 1.46 per 100 procedures. Although the individual study measures were less variable than those for hypoparathyroidism, the measures were based on very small numbers of events. Patients who have total thyroidectomy also require lifelong thyroid-replacement therapy and corresponding blood level monitoring.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> In patients who undergo total thyroidectomy, the process of optimizing hormone replacement therapy and the resultant changes in other medications, weight, or estrogen status may cause iatrogenic hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.</Para><Para id="_34">Patients with malignant nodules have additional risks if they receive radioactive iodine therapy. Studies of harms of radioactive iodine treatment addressed the risk of second primary malignancy and permanent harms on the salivary glands. The authors concluded, from the available eight studies, that there is a small increase in primary second malignancies, of 12 to 13 excess cancers per 10,000 patients.<Reference refidx="1"/> The authors expressed some concern with that estimate, though, given differences in study designs, reporting of administered doses, and the fact that changes in indication and dose had occurred over time.<Reference refidx="1"/> The most-common permanent salivary adverse effect was xerostomia (dry mouth), which is a risk factor for dental caries; the percentage of affected individuals ranged from 2.3% to 35%.<Reference refidx="1"/> Xerostomia increases the chance of dental decay, demineralization of teeth, tooth sensitivity, and oral infections.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_35">The harms of surgery and radioactive iodine treatments raise concerns because many of these treated cancers may not progress to cause morbidity and mortality. There are no randomized controlled trials of thyroid cancer screening that could be used to estimate overdiagnosis, but it is clear from ecological data that thyroid cancer screening results in detection of thyroid cancers that would not have been diagnosed otherwise.<Reference refidx="10"/> Increases in incidence without changes in mortality in South Korea and other countries in which opportunistic thyroid cancer screening occurs cannot be explained by changes in treatment or risk factor prevalence over the years. Investigators measured thyroid cancer overdiagnosis by studying cancer registry data from high-income countries, estimating age-specific trends in thyroid cancer incidence in the 1960s before ultrasound was introduced, then comparing the shape of the age-specific curves since the 1980s.<Reference refidx="10"/> The investigators reported the rate of overdiagnosis in the United States to be increasing and estimated that it accounted for 77% of thyroid cancer cases. The estimation for overdiagnosis in South Korea was 90% of thyroid cancers cases.</Para><Para id="_36">Autopsy studies also lend credence to overdiagnosis resulting from thyroid cancer screening.<Reference refidx="1"/> A 2014 review of 15 autopsy studies reported a 12% yield of papillary thyroid cancers, although the range across studies was wide (1%–36%). Natural history studies have demonstrated the slow-growing nature of thyroid tumors, tumor stability, and low potential for recurrence.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="11"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="28492904">Lin JS, Bowles EJA, Williams SB, et al.: Screening for Thyroid Cancer: Updated Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.
