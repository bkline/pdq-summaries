Knowledge of cell surface markers and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements may help with diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The clonal excess of light-chain immunoglobulin may differentiate malignant cells from reactive cells. Because the prognosis and the approach to treatment are influenced by histopathology, outside biopsy specimens should be carefully reviewed by a hematopathologist who is experienced in diagnosing lymphomas. Although lymph node biopsies are recommended whenever possible, sometimes immunophenotypic data are sufficient for diagnosis of lymphoma when fine-needle aspiration cytology or core needle biopsy is preferred.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1625"><Title>Historical Classification Systems</Title><Para id="_1627">Historically, uniform treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has been hampered by the lack of a uniform classification system.

different manifestations of the same neoplasm, as are lymphoblastic lymphomas

deferred until the patient becomes symptomatic as the disease progresses.  When
treatment is deferred, the clinical course of patients with indolent NHL

treatment can be initiated when the clinical course of the disease accelerates. 
Some patients have a prolonged indolent course, but others have disease that

treatment.</Para><Para id="_1573">Radiation techniques differ somewhat from those used in the treatment of
Hodgkin lymphoma.  The dose of radiation therapy usually varies from 25 Gy to
50 Gy and is dependent on factors that include the histological type of
lymphoma, the patient’s stage and overall condition, the goal of treatment
(curative or palliative), the proximity of sensitive surrounding organs, and
whether the patient is being treated with radiation therapy alone or in
combination with chemotherapy.  Given the patterns of
disease presentations and relapse, treatment may need to include unusual sites
such as Waldeyer ring, epitrochlear nodes, or mesenteric nodes.   The
associated morbidity of the treatment  must be considered carefully.  Most patients who receive radiation are treated on only one side

Given the increased rates of febrile neutropenia in patients who receive Pola-R-CHP and the significant financial toxicity, it is reasonable to consider R-CHOP as a standard regimen for patients with GCB-subtype DLBCL without a double-hit variant. However, assessing the GCB subtype using commercially available immunophenotyping is less accurate than using the molecular genetic signatures used in the POLARIX study. Some patients may miss the PFS benefit of polatuzumab.
