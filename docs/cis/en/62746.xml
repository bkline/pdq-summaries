psychiatric history.  The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has produced
guidelines for the use of polysomnography as an objective tool in evaluating
insomnia.  The routine polysomnogram includes the monitoring of the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_234" Style="bullet">

suspected sleep-related breathing disorders and periodic limb movement
disorder, when the cause of insomnia is uncertain, or when behavioral or

One descriptive study <Reference refidx="7"/><LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">[Level of evidence: II]</LOERef> involving 398 women with breast cancer used the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS) to identify three different sleep trajectories when self-reported sleep was evaluated beginning before surgery and continuing for 6 months. One group (55% of the sample) had a high level of sleep disturbance throughout the study, defined as scores on the GSDS of about 58 to 60 at all data points. A second group (40% of the sample) was considered to have a low level of sleep disturbance throughout, defined as scores on the GSDS in the low 30s at each data point. The final group (5% of the sample) started out high, with scores around 62, but their scores decreased to below 30 over the first 4 months and remained there through month 6. Participants identified as having a more severe sleep disorder were significantly younger, had more comorbidities, had a lower performance status, and experienced hot flashes. In another study, of 232 women with gynecologic cancers that assessed sleep using the GSDS at six time points over two cycles of chemotherapy,  four distinct subgroups of patients with sleep disturbance  were identified (Low, 18.5%; Moderate, 43.6%; High, 29.3%; Very High, 8.6%).<Reference refidx="8"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Participants with the worst sleep disturbance were younger, had a higher body mass index, and were more likely to report depression or back pain.</Para><Para id="_255">Sleep disturbances frequently co-occur with cancer-related fatigue and may have common underlying mechanisms. Prospective and multidimensional assessments of these two symptoms were conducted in a study involving patients who were newly diagnosed with stage I through stage IIIA breast cancer (N = 152).<Reference refidx="9"/> Assessments included validated sleep and fatigue questionnaires and objective sleep assessments using wrist actigraphy, which measure sleep-wake patterns and circadian rhythms. Assessments were conducted before initiation of chemotherapy (T1) and during the last week of the fourth cycle of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (T2). Most patients in the group characterized by severe symptoms at T1 were also in a higher-symptoms group at T2. Similarly, many patients in that group at T1 remained in the minimal-symptoms group at T2. From T1 to T2, the average-symptoms group was relatively unstable compared with the severe- and minimal-symptoms groups. At both time points, younger patients reported more severe symptoms, and married patients reported less severe symptoms. Patients who reported more comorbidities, more use of medications, and other indicators of worse health (e.g., higher BMI) were more likely to be in the group characterized by higher symptom severity at both time points.      </Para><Para id="_259">In addition, stress can contribute to sleep disturbance. A study of 957 patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment for breast, lung, gastrointestinal, or gynecological cancer measured responses to validated stress/resilience assessment instruments (14-item Perceived Stress Scale,  22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, 30-item Life Stressor Checklist-Revised, and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale). Compared with patients classified in a normative or resilient class, patients in the stressed class had significantly higher levels of sleep disturbance. Also, each of the domains of sleep disturbance within the validated 21-item GSDS (quantity, quality, sleep onset latency, mid-sleep awakening, early awakenings, and excessive daytime sleepiness) and use of medications to help with sleep were statistically significant and crossed clinically meaningful cutoff points for patients in the stressed class.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_27" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Risk Factors for Sleep Disorders</ListTitle><ListItem>Disease factors, including paraneoplastic syndromes with increased steroid

These agents promote sleep by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA type A (GABAA) receptor. Unlike traditional benzodiazepines, these agents preferentially target specific GABAA receptor subtypes. Zolpidem and zaleplon  bind predominantly to the alpha-1 subtype of GABAA, and eszopiclone preferentially targets the  alpha-3 receptor subtype. This selective receptor subtype targeting has both advantages and disadvantages. These agents have mainly hypnotic/sedative effects and lack the anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant effects seen with benzodiazepines. Conversely, because of the selective receptor subtype targeting, these agents have fewer effects on cognitive and psychomotor function and carry less risk of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal (especially physical withdrawal) than benzodiazepines.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_179">These agents may be preferred for use in patients with cancer when only hypnotic effects are desired  and should be taken just before bedtime (or even in bed)  because they enter the brain very quickly.

Benzodiazepines are preferred when other effects (such as antianxiety or muscle relaxation) are desirable with or without the hypnotic effects.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_180">Benzodiazepines carry a much higher risk of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal than nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists. Benzodiazepine withdrawal has been associated with the risk of seizures, delirium tremens, autonomic instability, and death. These agents should be used with extreme caution and close monitoring in patients with histories of significant substance use because of potential tolerance and dependence issues. Benzodiazepines have also been associated with cognitive impairment and difficulties with motor coordination.</Para><Para id="_181">Generally, benzodiazepines with longer half-lives (e.g., clonazepam) are associated with a higher risk of residual morning sedation and cognitive/motor impairments. Agents with shorter elimination half-lives (e.g., lorazepam) are generally preferred for short-term anxiolytic effects and difficulties falling asleep and in older patients. Agents with longer half-lives (e.g., clonazepam) are preferred for the treatment of persistent anxiety and difficulties falling and staying asleep. All benzodiazepines are associated with risk of respiratory depression and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting respiratory disorders.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_161"><Title>Melatonin receptor agonists: Ramelteon and tasimelteon</Title><Para id="_162">Ramelteon and tasimelteon work by binding to the melatonin receptor types MT1 and MT2. Ramelteon is useful only for the treatment of difficulties falling asleep and does not have any other effects, such as anxiolytic or myorelaxant effects. Tasimelteon is indicated for use in circadian sleep disorder. These agents do not treat difficulties staying asleep but also carry much less risk of cognitive/motor impairments and dependence.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="39"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_163"><Title>Antihistamines</Title><Para id="_164">Diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine decrease arousal by blockading histamine receptors. Antihistamines are sold over the counter and are useful for treating difficulties in falling asleep only. There is limited evidence for the use of antihistamines to treat insomnia; these agents are used when traditional hypnotics or benzodiazepines are less suitable because of the  risk of cross-dependence or other issues, such as vulnerability of a patient to addictions. The anticholinergic properties of antihistamines may also be beneficial in the treatment of nausea and vomiting. The sedative and anticholinergic properties of these agents increase the risk of delirium, especially in older patients.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_165"><Title>Antidepressants</Title><Para id="_166">Sedating antidepressants are considered first-line agents when insomnia is comorbid with depression/anxiety symptomatology. These drugs  include tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) and second-generation antidepressants (e.g., mirtazapine). The sedating effects of tricyclic antidepressants are caused mainly by  histamine receptor blockading and partially by blockading of 5-HT2 and muscarinic receptors. The sedating effects of mirtazapine are caused by  its blocking of 5-HT2 and histamine receptors, while those of trazodone are caused by  its blocking actions at the at histamine, 5-HT, and noradrenaline receptors.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/> For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739#_305" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Pharmacological Intervention</SummaryRef> section in Depression.</Para><Para id="_167">Tricyclic antidepressants have a small therapeutic window and can be lethal in overdose, compared with second-generation antidepressants such as mirtazapine. Additionally, tricyclics carry other risks, such as weight gain, anticholinergic side effects, and cardiovascular side effects, and should be used under close supervision.  These agents sometimes are used in low doses (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062746#_220" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/sleep-disorders-hp-pdq">Table 3</SummaryRef>) as adjuncts to other antidepressants to treat insomnia comorbid with depression/anxiety. This helps to avoid the side effects associated with higher doses while delivering the needed sedating effects. Tricyclics can also boost appetite and may be the treatment of choice for insomnia in patients with comorbid cachexia. Certain tricyclics (amitriptyline and nortriptyline) can also be beneficial in the treatment of pain syndromes (e.g., neuropathic pain) and headaches when these issues are comorbid with insomnia. Low doses of antidepressants (subtherapeutic for depression) are frequently used to treat insomnia without any comorbidities.</Para><Para id="_168">Mirtazapine has appetite-stimulating and antiemetic properties in addition to sedating effects. It is frequently used  in insomniac patients with depression (therapeutic dose for depression, 15–45 mg) or without depression (subtherapeutic dose for depression, 7.5–15 mg) with comorbid nausea or loss of appetite. In low doses, trazodone (50–100 mg) can promote sleep and is often combined with other antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine 20 mg in the morning) in depressed patients with insomnia.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_169"><Title>Antipsychotics</Title><Para id="_170">Antipsychotics such as quetiapine have sedating effects caused  mainly by the blockade of histamine receptors.
