a shift in histological type and primary tumor location. Worldwide, squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histology, and was historically more prevalent in the United States.

The esophagus extends from the larynx to the stomach and lies in the posterior mediastinum within the thorax near the lung pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, and diaphragm.  As it travels into the abdominal cavity, the esophagus makes an abrupt turn and enters the stomach.  The most muscular segment of the gastrointestinal system, the esophagus is composed of inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle layers.  The upper and lower esophagus are controlled by the sphincter function of the cricopharyngeus muscle and gastroesophageal sphincter, respectively.  The esophagus has a rich network of lymphatic channels concentrated in the lamina propria and submucosa, which drains longitudinally along the submucosa.  </Para><Para id="_403">Tumors of the esophagus are conventionally described in terms of distance of the upper border of the tumor to the incisors.
