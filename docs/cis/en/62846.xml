Treatment of retinoblastoma aims to save the patient's life and preserve useful vision. For patients presenting with extraocular retinoblastoma, treatment with systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy is likely to be curative. However, extraorbital disease requires intensive chemotherapy and may include consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue with or without radiation therapy. While a large proportion of patients with systemic extra–central nervous system (CNS) metastases can be cured, the prognosis for patients with intracranial disease is dismal.</Para><SummarySection id="_486"><Title>Incidence</Title><Para id="_487">Retinoblastoma is a relatively uncommon tumor of childhood that arises in the
retina. It accounts for about 3% of the cancers occurring in children younger

Two-thirds of all cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed before age 2 years.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Thus, while the estimated annual incidence in the United States is approximately 3 cases per 1 million children younger than 20 years, the age-adjusted annual incidence in children aged 0 to 4 years is 18.4 cases per 1 million.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_716"><Title>Anatomy</Title><Para id="_717">Retinoblastoma arises in the retina, and it may grow under the retina and/or toward the vitreous cavity.

After invading the choroid, the tumor gains access to systemic circulation and creates the potential for metastases. Further progression through the ocular coats leads to invasion of the sclera and the orbit. Tumors that invade the anterior chamber may gain access to systemic circulation through the canal of Schlemm. Progression through the optic nerve and past the lamina cribrosa increases the risk of systemic and CNS dissemination (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062846#_1850" url="/types/retinoblastoma/hp/retinoblastoma-treatment-pdq">Figure 1</SummaryRef>). </Para><Para id="_727"><MediaLink ref="CDR0000798975" type="image/jpeg" alt="Anatomy of the eye; drawing shows the sclera, ciliary body, canal of Schlemm, cornea, iris, lens, vitreous humor, retina, choroid, optic nerve, and lamina cribrosa." language="en" placement="image-center" id="_1850"><Caption language="en">Figure 1.

To further assess the significance of tumor seeding, a multicenter, international, registry-based analysis of  eyes with retinoblastoma investigated whether the distribution and clinical characteristics of retinoblastoma seeds in cT2b eyes affect local treatment failure.  Of the 624 eyes in which eye salvage was attempted, 592 had complete data for globe-salvage analysis.  The distribution of seeds was focal in 143 eyes (24.2%) and diffuse in 449 eyes (75.8%). At presentation, diffuse seeding was associated with a 2.8-fold risk of eventual local treatment failure, compared with focal retinoblastoma seeding.  The 5-year Kaplan-Meier cumulative globe-salvage rate (without external-beam radiation therapy) was 78% for eyes with focal seeding and 49% for eyes with diffuse seeding.
