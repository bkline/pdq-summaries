Head and neck squamous cell cancers most commonly arise from the mucosal surfaces lining the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. Anatomically, the pharynx includes the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx, but cancers in these sites have distinct clinical and epidemiologic characteristics. Thus, it is inappropriate to group them together.<Reference refidx="1"/> For more information, see the following PDQ summaries:</Para><ItemizedList id="_315" Style="bullet"><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062922" url="/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq">Laryngeal Cancer Treatment</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062930" url="/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/lip-mouth-treatment-pdq">Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer Treatment</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062918" url="/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/nasopharyngeal-treatment-pdq">Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Treatment</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062924" url="/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/oropharyngeal-treatment-pdq">Oropharyngeal Cancer Treatment</SummaryRef></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_316"><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062837#_1" url="/types/head-and-neck/hp/oral-prevention-pdq">Figure 1</SummaryRef> shows the anatomy of the pharynx.</Para><MediaLink ref="CDR0000713970" type="image/jpeg" alt="Anatomy of the pharynx; drawing shows the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx.

Most studies suggest that the risk of oral cavity and laryngeal cancer decreases as time from cessation increases; one pooled analysis of 13 studies observed a statistically significant reduction (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26–0.78) for oral cavity and laryngeal cancers (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52–0.91), relative to current drinkers, for those who ceased consumption 20 years or more ago. Among never-smokers, cessation of alcohol consumption leads to a decrease in oral cavity and laryngeal cancer risk more than 1 to 4 years after cessation. Data for oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers did not support risk reduction with alcohol cessation.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_238"><Title>Vaccination Against Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 16 (HPV-16) and Other High-Risk Subtypes</Title><Para id="_243">Vaccination against HPV-16 and type 18 (HPV-18) has been shown to prevent approximately 90% of oral HPV-16/HPV-18 infections within 4 years of vaccination.<Reference refidx="2"/> <Reference refidx="3"/> Given the relatively recent adoption of vaccination and the age at which individuals are vaccinated, there is not yet evidence that vaccination at a young age will lead to a substantially reduced risk of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer later in life.
