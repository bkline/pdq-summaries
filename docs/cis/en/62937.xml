kidney tumors, and transitional cell cancer of the ureter accounts for only
4% of upper urinary  tract tumors. These cancers are curable in more than 90% of patients if
they are superficial and confined to the renal pelvis or ureter.  Patients with
deeply invasive tumors that are confined to the renal pelvis or ureter
have a 10% to 15% likelihood of cure.  Patients with tumors with penetration
through the urothelial wall or with distant metastases usually cannot be cured
with available forms of treatment.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_127"><Title>Prognosis</Title><Para id="_128">The major prognostic factor at
the time of diagnosis of upper tract transitional cell cancer is the depth of

synchronous or metachronous contralateral upper tract cancers ranges from 2% to

can be determined only at the time of nephroureterectomy, which is the
treatment of choice for patients with this disease.  Because of the high

the entire ureter and a margin of periureteral orifice mucosa (i.e., bladder cuff).

ureteral cancers undergo total nephroureterectomy with
bladder cuff excision. This treatment is because of the rarity of synchronous bilateral renal pelvic neoplasia, the low incidence
of asynchronous development of contralateral upper tract tumors, and the
increased risk of tumor recurrence in the ipsilateral ureter distal to the
original pelvic tumor.
</Para><Para id="_51">Contemplation of anything less than total excision must take into account the
potential risk for tumor recurrence anywhere in the upper tract unit.  In other
than unifocal, low-grade, low-stage renal pelvic tumors, the probable extensive
involvement of both contiguous and noncontiguous sites would appear to make
segmental excision an unnecessary option with a potentially serious risk. 
However, an operative possibility includes segmental excision of a particular
lesion.  If the extent of a tumor can be determined by intraoperative
assessment and frozen section histological diagnosis confirms a low-grade,
unifocal tumor of limited size, then segmental excision is possible.  However,
this approach should be reserved for highly selected patients such as patients with one kidney or those with decreased renal
function  who require maximal preservation of renal tissue.  The likelihood
of tumor recurrence in this setting, and of extension of disease outside the
renal pelvis once the pelvis has been violated, is a serious risk that must be
heavily weighed in offering a patient this therapeutic option.
</Para><Para id="_52">Ureteral transitional cell cancer may more readily offer the possibility of
segmental excision if the absence of proximal disease can be documented.  In
this setting, attention is focused on the ease of reconstruction of the ureter
and restoration of ureterovesical continuity.  This treatment is most feasible if the
cancer is in the distal ureter.  If partial ureterectomy is possible and
proximal disease has been excluded, then segmental excision and ureteral
reimplantation can be performed.
</Para><Para id="_53">Systematic regional lymph node dissection in conjunction with
nephroureterectomy or segmental excision has not been found to enhance the
effectiveness of surgery if tumors are of high grade or high stage because, in
these instances, the overall results are so poor.  Correspondingly, lymph node
involvement is uncommon in low-stage disease, and lymphadenectomy is 
unlikely to remove additional tumor.  Lymph node dissection at the time
of nephrectomy may offer prognostic information, but little, if any,
therapeutic benefit.

for superficial transitional cell cancers in the bladder has led to the
occasional use of these agents in the treatment of upper tract cancers. 
Long-term follow-up of the results of such treatments has generally not been
reported. The efficacy of this approach cannot be assessed, largely because
experience has been limited to patients whose compromised clinical status
(solitary kidney, renal failure, medical risks for surgery) may have influenced
clinical outcome.  The use of this approach is limited by the following:  <ItemizedList id="_158" Style="bullet">

the upper tract have permitted the use of laser therapy in the control of
superficial upper tract transitional cell cancers.  This approach is dependent
on accurate staging and adequate visualization of the lesions that need to be
coagulated.  Results of this approach are too preliminary to assess. 
Therapeutic efficacy, however, will depend on staging accuracy at initial
treatment and the ease of monitoring such patients for disease recurrence and
possible progression.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_159">The development of new instrumentation for endourological treatment of upper
tract transitional cell cancer has provided new options for regional management
of these cancers.  Introduction of electrofulguration and resection instruments
or laser probes either transureterally or percutaneously, may permit destruction
of a primary cancer.  Introduction of cytotoxic agents has also been used. 
Although a biopsy can be taken for staging purposes, its accuracy remains to be determined.  The efficacy of treatment by these maneuvers has not
been established.
