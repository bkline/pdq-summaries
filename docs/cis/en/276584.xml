Many patients experience unintentional weight loss leading to a diagnosis of cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> Studies have reported malnutrition in 30% to 85% of patients with cancer.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> In addition, malnutrition increases treatment toxicities, diminishes quality of life, and accounts for 10% to 20% of mortality in patients with cancer.<Reference refidx="5"/><LOERef href="CDR0000663089" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">[Level of evidence: IV]</LOERef> Because there has previously been no universal definition of malnutrition, reports of malnutrition occurrence vary and may be underreported or overreported in different populations.

In an observational study of patients in outpatient clinics, anorexia was reported by 26% of patients receiving chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="17"/>  Anorexia can be exacerbated by chemotherapy and radiation therapy side effects such as taste and smell changes, nausea, and vomiting. Surgical procedures, including esophagectomy and gastrectomy, may produce early satiety, a premature feeling of fullness.<Reference refidx="18"/> Depression, loss of personal interests or hope, and anxious thoughts may be enough to bring about anorexia and result in malnutrition.<Reference refidx="19"/> Anorexia is an almost-universal symptom in individuals with widely metastatic disease <Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/> because of physiologic alterations in metabolism during carcinogenesis.</Para><Para id="_25">Anorexia can hasten the course of cachexia,<Reference refidx="19"/>  a progressive wasting syndrome evidenced by weakness and a marked and progressive loss of body weight, fat, and muscle. It can develop in individuals who have adequate protein and calorie intake but have primary cachexia whereby tumor-related factors prevent maintenance of fat and muscle. Patients with diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are particularly at risk of developing anorexia.

A meta-analysis of 38 studies found that a low skeletal muscle index at cancer diagnosis was associated with worse survival in patients with solid tumors.<Reference refidx="8"/> Other studies have also reported poorer overall survival and increased chemotherapy toxicity in patients with sarcopenia.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="9"/> Sarcopenic obesity may represent a chronic low-level inflammatory state that, as with disease-related malnutrition, often limits the effectiveness of nutrition interventions and requires successful treatment of the underlying disease or condition.<Reference refidx="11"/> Sarcopenia is associated with increased toxicity of treatment and therefore treatment interruptions and dose reductions.  It is reported to occur in 50% of patients with advanced cancer.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_28">Sarcopenic obesity is the presence of sarcopenia in individuals with a high BMI (≥25 kg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>), often precipitated by the loss of skeletal muscle and gain of adipose tissue.

In this study, the combination arm was found to be superior. Another trial used megestrol alone versus megestrol plus L-carnitine, celecoxib, and antioxidants to treat 104 women with gynecologic malignancies.<Reference refidx="90"/> Again, the combination arm was found to be superior. Conversely, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of megestrol acetate and placebo versus megestrol acetate and celecoxib found no significant difference in weight gain, quality of life, appetite score, or grip strength between the two groups. However, both groups showed improvements, suggesting a benefit of  the single-agent use of megestrol acetate.<Reference refidx="54"/></Para><Para id="_377">Researchers also looked at the combination of formoterol, an anabolic beta-2 adrenergic agonist, and megestrol acetate in 13 patients. Six of seven evaluable patients achieved a major response, with increases in muscle mass.<Reference refidx="49"/> Conversely, another study looking at megestrol plus meloxicam versus  meloxicam plus EPA versus megestrol plus meloxicam and EPA showed no advantage to the three-drug regimen.<Reference refidx="92"/> However, such combinations also may result in increased cumulative toxicity. For these reasons, there is no recommended combination at this time. In addition, combining drug therapy with nutrition support and increased physical activity may have even greater efficacy.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_378"><Title>Summary of pharmaceutical treatment strategies</Title><Para id="_379">CAS is a complex, multifactorial complication of cancer and its therapy, resulting in weight loss and decreased lean body mass. As understanding of the mechanisms of CAS improves and new agents that selectively target proposed pathways become available, more efficacious treatments are expected to become available. Trials of new agents must be able to compare similar groups of patients. In addition, treating preventively in high-risk patients, as opposed to treating patients already experiencing CAS, may have better outcomes. Further clinical trials are essential to determine the best possible therapies.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Grant BL: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Pocket Guide to the Nutrition Care Process and Cancer.

There is strong evidence that a vegetarian diet reduces the incidence of many types of cancer, especially cancers of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.<Reference refidx="4"/> However, it is unknown how following a vegetarian or vegan diet can affect treatment-induced symptoms, cancer therapies, or outcomes for someone undergoing cancer therapy. There are no published clinical trials, pilot studies, or case reports on the effectiveness of a vegetarian diet for the management of cancer therapy and symptoms. There is no evidence suggesting a benefit of adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet upon diagnosis or while undergoing cancer therapy.

The diet consists of 35% to 50% (by weight) whole grains, 25% to 35% vegetables, 5% to 10% soup, 5% to 10% cooked vegetables and sea vegetables, and 5% to 10% fish.</Para><Para id="_249">Although there are anecdotal reports of the effectiveness of a macrobiotic diet as an alternative cancer therapy, none has been published in peer-reviewed, scientific journals.

An intervention group received tailored dietary counseling, discount cards for healthy foods, delivery of free food, and an invitation to attend a cooking course. A control group received no dietary intervention. At 6 months, the intervention group had a lower weight gain and fat mass gain than the control group. At both 6 and 12 months, the intervention group had a lower increase in the ratio of fat mass to fat-free mass compared with the control group (cited Alavi et al. as reference 14).</Para><Para id="_disclaimerHP_3">This summary is written and maintained by the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care">PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board</ExternalRef>, which is
