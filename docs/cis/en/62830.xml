tested in clinical trials.

This may be at least partially responsible for declines in gastric cancer rates. There is a consistent association between high salt intake and the risk of gastric cancer. </Para><Para id="_148">Epidemiological evidence from case-control and cohort studies suggests that increased intake of fresh fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased gastric cancer rates.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  However, no randomized controlled trials have been done to establish a causal association.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_149"><Title>Dietary Supplements</Title><Para id="_150">Because of the evidence for an inverse association between gastric cancer and dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, especially those rich in antioxidants, there has been interest in dietary supplementation with antioxidants.</Para><Para id="_151">Dietary indices of micronutrient intake have been calculated and indicate possible protective effects of beta carotene, vitamin A, vitamin E, selenium, vitamin C, or foods that contain these compounds. A chemoprevention trial in China reported a statistically significant reduction in the gastric cancer mortality rate after supplementation with beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium.<Reference refidx="4"/> The population studied, however, may have been nutritionally deficient, raising questions of generalizability to other populations such as that of the United States. In addition, the experimental design did not permit assessment of the relative effects of beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium.</Para><Para id="_152">Likewise, there was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 200 mg of oral allitridum (a component of garlic) every day combined with 100 mcg of oral selenium every other day for 1 month of each year over a 3-year period. The study took place in Qixia County (Shandong Province, China), an area with low intake of garlic and low selenium content in their garlic compared with other areas of China.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Although designed as a double-blinded trial, researchers noted that allitridum causes a distinctive garlic odor.  Investigators randomly assigned 5,033 people, who met at least one of the following criteria: (1) medical history of stomach disorder, (2) family history of tumor, (3) history of smoking, or (4) history of alcohol consumption.  The study, published in a Chinese medical journal, was not well described.  After a follow-up of up to 11 years, there were 23 gastric cancer cases in the allitridum/selenium group and 30 cases in the placebo group (relative risk [RR] after adjustment for several baseline characteristics, 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21–1.06).  Only 60% of the gastric cancers were diagnosed by histopathology.  There was a qualitative difference in outcome by sex: RR<Subscript>men</Subscript>, 0.36 (95% CI, 0.14–0.92); RR<Subscript>women</Subscript>,  1.14 (95% CI, 0.22–5.76).  Given the problems with design and reporting of the study, the evidence of benefit (including men) was weak and may not be generalizable to Western countries.</Para><Para id="_153">In a randomized, double-blind, chemoprevention trial in Venezuela among a population at increased risk for gastric cancer, a combination of antioxidant vitamins (vitamins C, E, and beta carotene) failed to modify progression or regression of precancerous gastric lesions.<Reference refidx="6"/> Another potential explanation for the lack of benefit of vitamin supplementation in this trial was the high prevalence of advanced premalignant lesions and the high <ScientificName>Helicobacter pylori</ScientificName> infection rate.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_154">A secondary analysis of the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta Carotene trial conducted in male smokers in Finland evaluated the effect of supplementation on gastric cancer incidence.<Reference refidx="8"/> No protective effects for these supplements against gastric cancer were observed. Six-year follow-up results of a study of 976 Colombian patients have been reported. Patients were randomly assigned to receive eight different treatments that included vitamin supplements and anti-<ScientificName>H. pylori</ScientificName> therapy either alone or in combination versus placebo. Among the 79 patients who received anti-<ScientificName>H. pylori</ScientificName> therapy, a borderline statistically significant regression of intestinal metaplasia compared with a placebo (15% vs. 6%; RR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.0–9.3) was noted. However, the combinations of antibiotics and vitamins did not confer additional benefits. More importantly, the progression rate of intestinal metaplasia was comparable regardless of the treatments received. The progression rate was 23% in the placebo group and 17% in antibiotic recipients.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_155">A systematic review examined randomized trials of antioxidant dietary supplements for the prevention of gastrointestinal cancers, including gastric cancer.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Twenty trials were identified that assessed the preventive effects of antioxidant supplements or vitamin C on gastrointestinal cancer.  With regard to gastric cancer, there were 12 comparisons of one or more micronutrients with placebo: beta-carotene alone (4 trials); vitamin C alone (1 trial); vitamin E alone (1 trial); vitamin A plus beta-carotene (1 trial); beta-carotene plus vitamin C (1 trial); beta-carotene plus vitamin E (1 trial); beta-carotene plus vitamins C and E (1 trial); selenium plus vitamins C and E (1 trial); and beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, and selenium (1 trial).  None of the comparisons showed a statistically significant effect on the incidence of gastric cancer.  The overall summary estimate across all trials of antioxidants showed no statistically significant effect (RR of gastric cancer, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.97–1.33). After treatment of 2.1 to 12 years and follow-up for as many as 14.1 years, approximately 0.51% of participants in the combined antioxidant groups developed gastric cancer versus 0.38% in the placebo groups.  In the combined analysis of all 20 trials of antioxidants for the prevention of gastrointestinal cancers, a fixed effects model showed an increase in overall mortality for antioxidants compared with placebo (RR for mortality, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02–1.07). A random effects model showed no such increase (RR for mortality, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.97–1.07).</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="24114476">D'Elia L, Galletti F, Strazzullo P: Dietary salt intake and risk of gastric cancer.
