myeloid series to immature forms that increase in number as patients progress
to the blastic phase of the disease.  The marrow is hypercellular, and
differential counts of both marrow and blood show a spectrum of mature and
immature granulocytes like that found in normal marrow.  Increased
numbers of eosinophils or basophils are often present, and monocytosis is sometimes seen.  Increased megakaryocytes are often found in the marrow,
and sometimes fragments of megakaryocytic nuclei are present in the blood,
especially when the platelet count is very high.  The percentage of lymphocytes
is reduced in both the marrow and blood compared with normal samples.
The myeloid:erythroid ratio in the marrow is usually greatly elevated.  The
leukocyte alkaline phosphatase enzyme is either absent or markedly reduced in
the neutrophils of patients with CML.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_7">Most patients do not require bone marrow examination. However, bone marrow testing is appropriate for patients with fever, malaise, rapidly enlarging splenomegaly, and more than 10% circulating blasts.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive asciminib or either imatinib mesylate or nilotinib, dasatinib, or bosutinib. A prespecified subgroup analysis compared asciminib with the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (not including imatinib). At week 48, 66.0% who received asciminib had a major molecular response (MMR), and 57.8% of patients who received second-generation TKIs had an MMR. The 8.2% difference was not statistically significant. In the first year, it appears that the efficacy of asciminib is equivalent to those of second-generation TKIs. Longer follow-up is required to fully assess efficacy and toxicity outcomes.</Para><Para id="_disclaimerHP_3">This summary is written and maintained by the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment">PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board</ExternalRef>, which is
