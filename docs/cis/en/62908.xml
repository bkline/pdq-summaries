The most common risk factor for bladder cancer in the United States is cigarette smoking.  It is estimated that cigarette smoking causes up to one-half of all bladder cancers and that smoking increases a person’s risk of bladder cancer two to four times above baseline risk.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/> Smokers with less functional polymorphisms of N-acetyltransferase-2 (known as slow acetylators) have a higher risk of bladder cancer than other smokers, presumably because of their reduced ability to detoxify carcinogens.</Para><Para id="_366">Certain occupational exposures have also been linked to bladder cancer, and higher rates of bladder cancer have been reported in textile dye and rubber tire industries; among painters; leather workers; shoemakers; and aluminum-, iron-, and steelworkers.  Specific chemicals linked to bladder carcinogenesis include beta-naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine. Although these chemicals are now generally banned in Western countries, many other chemicals still in use are also suspected of causing bladder cancer.<Reference refidx="20"/> </Para><Para id="_367">Exposure to the chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide has also been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.</Para><Para id="_318">Chronic urinary tract infections and infection with the parasite <ScientificName>S. haematobium</ScientificName> have also been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, often squamous cell carcinomas.  Chronic inflammation is thought to play a key role in carcinogenesis in these settings.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_21"><Title>Clinical Features</Title><Para id="_22">Bladder cancer typically presents with gross or microscopic hematuria.  Less commonly, patients may complain of urinary frequency, nocturia, and dysuria, symptoms that are more common in patients with carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>.  Patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas may present with pain resulting from  obstruction by the tumor. </Para><Para id="_368">Urothelial carcinomas are often multifocal—the entire urothelium needs to be evaluated if a tumor is found.  In patients with bladder cancer, upper urinary tract imaging is essential for staging and surveillance.  This can be accomplished with ureteroscopy, retrograde pyelograms during cystoscopy, intravenous pyelograms, or computed tomography (CT) urograms.  Similarly, patients with an upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma have a high risk of developing bladder cancer; these patients need periodic cystoscopy and surveillance of the contralateral upper urinary tract. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_23"><Title>Diagnostics</Title><Para id="_24">When bladder cancer is suspected, the most useful diagnostic test is cystoscopy. Radiological studies such as CT scans or ultrasound do not have sufficient sensitivity to detect bladder cancers.  Cystoscopy can be performed in a urology clinic.  </Para><Para id="_369">If cancer is seen on cystoscopy, the patient is typically scheduled for bimanual examination under anesthesia and a repeat cystoscopy in an operating room so that transurethral resection of the tumor(s) and/or biopsies can be performed.  If a high-grade cancer (including carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>) or invasive cancer is seen, the patient is staged with a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (or CT urogram) and either a chest x-ray or chest CT scan.  Patients with a nonhepatic elevation of alkaline phosphatase  or symptoms suggestive of bone metastases undergo a bone scan.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_27"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_265">The major prognostic factors in carcinoma of the bladder include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_447" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Depth of invasion into the bladder wall.</ListItem><ListItem>Pathological grade of the tumor.</ListItem><ListItem>Presence versus absence of carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_319">Among nonmuscle-invasive cancers, the following factors are also prognostic:<Reference refidx="21"/> </Para><ItemizedList id="_320" Style="bullet"><ListItem>	Number of tumors. </ListItem><ListItem>	Tumor size (e.g., &gt;3 cm or &lt;3 cm). </ListItem><ListItem>Invasion of the lamina propria (Ta vs. T1). </ListItem><ListItem>	Whether the tumor is the primary tumor or a recurrence. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_267">Most superficial tumors are well differentiated. Patients in whom superficial tumors are less differentiated, large, multiple, or associated with carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> (Tis) in other areas of the bladder mucosa are at greatest risk of recurrence and the development of invasive cancer. These patients may be considered to have the entire urothelial surface at risk of cancer development.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_29"><Title>Survival</Title><Para id="_321">Patients who die of bladder cancer almost always have disease that has metastasized from the bladder to other organs.  Low-grade bladder cancers rarely grow into the muscular wall of the bladder and rarely metastasize, so patients with low-grade (grade I) bladder cancers rarely die of their cancer.  Nonetheless, they may experience multiple relapses that need to be resected.  </Para><Para id="_322">Almost all deaths from bladder cancer are among patients with high-grade disease, which has a much greater potential to invade deeply into the bladder’s muscular wall and spread to other organs.  </Para><Para id="_268">Approximately 70% to 80% of patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer present with superficial bladder tumors (i.e., stage Ta, Tis, or T1). The prognosis of these patients depends largely on the grade of the tumor.  Patients with high-grade tumors have a significant risk of dying of their cancer, even if it is not muscle-invasive.<Reference refidx="22"/> Among patients with high-grade tumors, those who present with superficial, nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer can usually be cured, and those with muscle-invasive disease can sometimes be cured.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/> Studies have demonstrated that some patients with distant metastases have achieved long-term complete response after being treated with combination chemotherapy regimens, although most such patients have metastases limited to their lymph nodes and have a near-normal performance status.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_270">There are clinical trials suitable for patients with all stages of bladder cancer. Whenever possible, patients should consider clinical trials designed to improve upon standard therapy.</Para><Para id="_459">General information about clinical trials is also available from the <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials">NCI website</ExternalRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_31"><Title>Follow-Up</Title><Para id="_32">Bladder cancer tends to recur, even when it is noninvasive at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, standard practice is to perform surveillance of the urinary tract after a diagnosis of bladder cancer.  However, no trials have been conducted to assess whether surveillance affects rates of progression, survival, or quality of life. In addition, clinical trials have not defined an optimal surveillance schedule. Urothelial carcinomas are thought to reflect a so-called field defect, whereby the cancer emerges because of  genetic variants that are widely present in the patient's bladder or entire urothelium.  Thus, people who have had a bladder tumor resected often subsequently have recurrent tumors in the bladder, often in different locations from the site of the initial tumor.  Similarly, but less commonly, they may have tumors appear in the upper urinary tract (i.e., in the renal pelvises or ureters).  </Para><Para id="_370">An alternative explanation for these patterns of recurrence is that cancer cells that are disrupted when a tumor is resected may reimplant elsewhere in the urothelium.  Support for this second theory is that tumors are more likely to recur downstream than upstream from the initial cancer.  Upper urinary tract cancers are more likely to recur in the bladder than bladder cancers are to recur in the upper urinary tract.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">National Cancer Institute: SEER Cancer Stat Facts: Bladder Cancer.
