groups in the United States. The
incidence of bladder cancer also increases with age.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>    It is estimated that 84,870 new cases of bladder cancer  are expected to occur in the United States in

Urothelial cancer can also rarely develop in the  lining of the renal pelvis, ureter, prostate, and urethra. Other important histological types include squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinomas account for less than 2% of primary bladder cancers, including metastases from the rectum, stomach, endometrium, breast, prostate, and ovary.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2025.

Reduction in environmental and occupational exposures would presumably reduce urothelial cancer risk. Differences in age, sex, race, and geographic distribution may reflect differences in environmental and occupational exposure to possible toxicants. Relevant exposures include chemical exposures; cigarette smoking; infection with bacteria, parasitic fungi, or viruses; and treatment with certain chemotherapeutic agents. A positive family history of bladder cancer has also been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> </Para><SummarySection id="_160"><Title>Smoking</Title><Para id="_161">Several populations with a variety of exposures appear to be at higher risk of developing bladder cancer. By far, the greatest known environmental risk factor in the general population is tobacco, especially cigarette smoking.<Reference refidx="1"/> Individuals who smoke have a fourfold to sevenfold increased risk of developing bladder cancer than individuals who have never smoked.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> Risk is reduced with cessation of smoking, but a relatively small decrease in incidence is seen for the first 5 to 7 years after cessation. Even after 10 years, the risk of an individual developing bladder cancer is still almost twice that of an individual who has never smoked.</Para><Para id="_162">Among the chemicals implicated in smoking-induced bladder cancer are
aminobiphenyl and its metabolites.<Reference refidx="1"/>  It is possible that inherited and 
inducible enzymes are important in the activation and detoxification of
aminobiphenyls and other putative bladder carcinogens.  These enzymes include
N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2),<Reference refidx="6"/> cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYT 1A2),<Reference refidx="7"/> and
glutathione S-transferase M 1.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Several studies have indicated that
specific genotypes and phenotypes of these enzymes and their activities,
particularly in the liver and urothelium, are associated with susceptibility to
smoking-induced bladder cancer and bladder cancer induced by other aryl amines,
particularly in industrially exposed populations.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  Not all of these
studies, however, have been well controlled for active or former smoking

developing bladder cancer, primarily aromatic amines, such as 2-naphthylamine, beta-naphthylamine, or 4-chloro-o-toluidine, present in the production
of dyes and benzidine and its derivatives;<Reference refidx="1"/>  possibly chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons;<Reference refidx="13"/> chlorination by-products

The prime carcinogen in these herbs appears to be aristolochic acid (AA) extracted from species of <ScientificName>Aristolochia</ScientificName>.<Reference refidx="19"/> Because of the diversity of  Chinese herbal regimens used in addition to AA, other unidentified phytotoxins may also play a role.<Reference refidx="20"/> The chronic nephropathy associated with ingestion of herbs contaminated with <ScientificName>A. fangchi</ScientificName> has been linked to urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter.

older reported to the state of Wisconsin tumor registry in 1988 
had blocks and slides reviewed by a single pathologist who did not know the
original diagnosis.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Fifty-seven percent of specimens were grade 1 or 2, stage
Ta or T1 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs); 19% were grade 3, stage Ta or T1 (or Tis) TCCs; and 24% were
muscularis propria invading or deeper (stage T2+), almost all of which were
grade 3 lesions or of nontransitional cell histologies.  Because of
Wisconsin’s small population of Black males aged 50 years and older (fewer than
3% of all bladder cancers occurred in non-White individuals),<Reference refidx="2"/> differences in grade and
stage at presentation between Black and White individuals could not be determined.
Similarly, this study did not look at females or at males younger than 50
years.      Because of
variability in histological interpretations of bladder cancers recorded by
tumor registries,<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> the presenting grade and stage of this malignancy in
Wisconsin is known only for males aged 50 years and older.</Para><Para id="_112">Almost all bladder malignancies originate on the uroepithelial surface.  Most patients who die of bladder cancer do so from metastatic disease;
treatment for metastatic bladder cancer is rarely, if ever, curative.<Reference refidx="5"/>  The
overwhelming majority of patients with metastases have concomitant or prior
muscularis propria (stage T2+) invading lesions.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Seventy percent to 90% of
patients with muscularis propria invading bladder cancer present with this
diagnosis; however,<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> they do not come from the much larger pool of patients
with recurring superficial TCCs.  The goal of
screening is the early detection of bladder cancer that is destined to become
muscle invading.  Although one study reported that approximately 30% of patients
with superficial TCC followed for 20 years eventually die of this
disease,<Reference refidx="9"/> these data remain unconfirmed, are at odds with other reports,<Reference refidx="10"/>
and may reflect outmoded patterns of diagnosis, classification, and management. </Para><Para id="_113">Because bladder cancer is almost never incidentally found at autopsy, the
preclinical duration in which it has not yet caused symptoms, but in which it
can be detected by cystoscopy, is probably brief.  This rapid growth rate is
supported by clinical experience <Reference refidx="11"/> and implies that screening would have to
be performed at frequent intervals.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="7879333" MedlineID="95185009">Messing EM, Young TB, Hunt VB, et al.: Comparison of bladder cancer outcome in men undergoing hematuria home screening versus those with standard clinical presentations.

In the general population, the prevalence of asymptomatic gross hematuria is about 2.5%, while the prevalence of asymptomatic microhematuria is about 13%.<Reference refidx="2"/> In a recent prospective analysis of patients attending a hematuria clinic in the United Kingdom, 183 of the 948 patients (19.2%) with gross hematuria were found to have bladder cancer on cystoscopy.<Reference refidx="3"/>  However, only 47 of the 982 patients (4.8%) with microhematuria were found to have bladder cancer.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_120"><Title>One-Time Hematuria Testing</Title><Para id="_121">Two groups have reported on the use of testing a single urine specimen for
blood to detect urologic malignancies, serious urinary tract diseases, and
bladder cancers.  Both studies were performed retrospectively to ascertain
information from patients who were seen at a large multispecialty clinic <Reference refidx="2"/> or
who subscribed to a large health maintenance organization (HMO) and were tested
in a multiphasic screening.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Because of the retrospective nature of each
study, neither was designed to specifically look for bladder cancer detection
or to focus on the population at highest risk (men aged 50 years and older). 
Both studies concluded that single hematuria testing was not effective in
diagnosing bladder cancer.  A longer follow-up of the HMO study indicated that
individuals with microhematuria were at a higher risk of subsequent
development of muscle-invading bladder cancer, with a latency of 3.5 to 14.5
years.<Reference refidx="5"/>  There is insufficient evidence to indicate that single hematuria
testing is effective in screening for bladder cancer, and there is no evidence
that single hematuria testing results in reduced mortality from the disease.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_122"><Title>Repetitive Hematuria Testing</Title><Para id="_123">Two studies using Ames Hemastix, a chemical reagent strip for hemoglobin that
correlates with microscopic urinalysis in detecting hematuria,<Reference refidx="6"/> were
conducted in geographically defined (Madison, Wisconsin and Leeds, England)
populations of middle-aged and older men using repetitive home reagent strip
testing.  In each program,  patients were solicited from patient care
registries.  Men with histories of previous urologic malignancies, or known
causes of hematuria, or who were noncompliant were eliminated.  In the four studies
performed (one pilot study and one larger study at each site), 45% to 55% of
solicited individuals took part.  In these studies, 1.2% to 1.3% of all
participants were found to have bladder cancer (all transitional cell carcinomas [TCCs]).  Only 1 of the 21
patients in the first study <Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> and none of the 26 detected in the second
study had stage T2 or greater malignancy.  As a limitation of repetitive
hematuria screening in a general population of men aged 50 years and older,
more than 90% of individuals with positive tests upon initial workup were
found not to have bladder cancer.<Reference refidx="6"/>  In the Wisconsin hematuria screening
studies, all patients who were hematuria positive with negative workups or who
were found to have no serious disease were followed for at least 24 months,
with no findings of developing bladder cancer.  Similarly, at least 18 months
after their last testing, no screening participant (with or without hematuria)
had died of bladder cancer. In the 14-year follow-up of this screening cohort, no participant with bladder cancer detected by hematuria screening had died of bladder cancer, while two (0.85%) with hematuria and a negative workup developed the disease 6.7 and 11.4 years after their negative workup. The same proportion of participants without hematuria during screening were diagnosed with bladder cancer (0.93%), none within 1 year after their last testing date.<Reference refidx="9"/> It is possible that longer follow-up is necessary
to prove that these participants did not have bladder cancer;<Reference refidx="5"/> however, such studies
are not available.  The relatively low positive predictive value of
repetitive hematuria testing (7.6% for bladder cancer and 11.6% for all
malignancies) <Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="10"/> raises questions about the practicality of this mode of
screening.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_134"><Title>Other Possible Screening Modalities</Title><Para id="_135">The accuracy of voided urine cytology in detecting bladder cancer has been
evaluated primarily in patients with histories of bladder cancer who are
undergoing cystoscopic surveillance or as a routine test performed in all
patients attending a large urology office in a multispecialty clinic.  In the 
studies of patients with histories of bladder cancer, voided urinary cytology 
was effective in diagnosing 20% to 40% of grade 1 TCCs, 20% to 50% of grade 2
malignancies, and 60% to 80% of grade 3/Tis cancers.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  Although such
studies were not performed in patients without either hematuria or histories of
recurrent bladder tumors, a major concern for screening purposes is the lack of
sensitivity for well-differentiated and moderately differentiated TCCs and the
large proportion of specimens in which an insufficient number of cells were
present for any cytologic diagnosis to be offered.  Although false-positive
results were exceedingly rare, the lack of sensitivity even in this highly suspect
population make voided urine cytology an inappropriate test for screening the
general population.  No studies have looked at outcome of cytologic screening
on disease-related mortality in a non–industrially exposed population.  Outcomes
of patients screened at the urology clinic are also not available.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_136">The outcomes of men diagnosed with bladder cancer through a hematuria home screening
program using a chemical reagent strip were compared with a statewide population-based sample of 87% of all men aged 50 years and older         from the
Wisconsin tumor registry.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Histological sections were blindly reviewed,
and   similar proportions of low-grade superficial versus high-grade or invasive cases were found;  the proportion of late-stage (T2 or higher) disease was lower in the screened patients. At  14 years, 20.4% of tumor
registry patients had died of bladder cancer (including 50% of those with muscle-invading grade 3 lesions); however, at 14 years of follow-up, no participant with bladder cancer detected by screening
had died of bladder cancer.<Reference refidx="13"/> Whether these differences resulted from some combination of
lead-time effect, overdiagnosis, and selection biases, a real screening effect cannot be determined.</Para><Para id="_137">The measurement of a variety of molecules and cellular elements screened in urine has been proposed, and in some cases marketed, to monitor previously diagnosed bladder cancer patients.
