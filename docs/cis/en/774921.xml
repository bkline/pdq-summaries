A decade ago it was possible to hope that targetable oncogenes, such as activated tyrosine kinases, might be identified in a high percentage of childhood cancers. However, it is now clear that the genomic landscape of childhood cancer is highly varied, and in many cases is quite distinctive from that of the common adult cancers.</Para><Para id="_21">There are examples of genomic lesions that have provided immediate therapeutic direction, including the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_1957" Style="bullet"><ListItem><GeneName>NPM</GeneName>::<GeneName>ALK</GeneName> fusion genes associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases.</ListItem><ListItem><GeneName>ALK</GeneName> single nucleotide variants associated with a subset of neuroblastoma cases.</ListItem><ListItem><GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> and other kinase genomic alterations associated with subsets of pediatric glioma cases.</ListItem><ListItem>Hedgehog pathway variants associated with a subset of medulloblastoma cases.</ListItem><ListItem><GeneName>ABL</GeneName> family genes activated by translocation in a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_22">For some cancers, the genomic findings have been highly illuminating in the identification of genomically defined subsets of patients within histologies that have distinctive biological features and distinctive clinical characteristics (particularly in terms of prognosis). In some instances, identification of these subtypes has resulted in early clinical translation as exemplified by the WNT subgroup of medulloblastoma. Because of its excellent outcome, the WNT subgroup will be studied separately in future medulloblastoma clinical trials so that reductions in therapy can be evaluated with the goal of maintaining favorable outcome while reducing long-term morbidity. However, the prognostic significance of the recurring genomic lesions for some other cancers remains to be defined.</Para><Para id="_23">A key finding from genomic studies is the extent to which the molecular characteristics of childhood cancers correlate with their tissue (cell) of origin. As with most adult cancers, variants in childhood cancers do not arise at random, but rather are linked in specific constellations to disease categories. A few examples include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_24" Style="bullet"><ListItem>The presence of H3.3 and H3.1 K27M variants almost exclusively among pediatric midline high-grade gliomas.</ListItem><ListItem>The loss of <GeneName>SMARCB1</GeneName> in rhabdoid tumors.</ListItem><ListItem>The presence of <GeneName>RELA</GeneName> translocations in supratentorial ependymomas.</ListItem><ListItem>The presence of specific fusion proteins in different pediatric sarcomas. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_25">Another theme across multiple childhood cancers is the contribution of variants of genes involved in normal development of the tissue of origin of the cancer and the contribution of genes involved in epigenomic regulation.</Para><Para id="_26">Structural variations play an important role for many childhood cancers. Translocations resulting in oncogenic fusion genes or overexpression of oncogenes play a central role, particularly for the leukemias and sarcomas. However, for other childhood cancers that are primarily characterized by structural variations, functional fusion genes are not produced. Mechanisms by which these recurring structural variations have oncogenic effects have been identified for osteosarcoma (translocations confined to the first intron of <GeneName>TP53</GeneName>) and medulloblastoma (structural variants juxtapose <GeneName>GFI1</GeneName> or <GeneName>GFI1B</GeneName> coding sequences proximal to active enhancer elements leading to transcriptional activation [enhancer hijacking]).<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> However, the oncogenic mechanisms of action for recurring structural variations of other childhood cancers (e.g., the segmental chromosomal alterations in neuroblastoma) need to be elucidated.</Para><Para id="_1954">Understanding of the contribution of germline variants to childhood cancer etiology is being advanced by the application of whole-genome and exome sequencing to cohorts of children with cancer. Estimates for rates of germline pathogenic variants approaching 10% have emerged from studies applying these sequencing methods to childhood cancer cohorts.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> In some cases, the germline pathogenic variants are clearly contributory to the patient’s cancer (e.g., <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> variants arising in the context of Li-Fraumeni syndrome), whereas in other cases, the contribution of the germline variant to the patient’s cancer is less clear (e.g., variants in adult cancer predisposition genes such as <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> that have an undefined role in childhood cancer predisposition).<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> The frequency of germline variants differs by tumor type (e.g., lower for neuroblastoma and higher for osteosarcoma),<Reference refidx="5"/> and many of the identified germline variants fit into known predisposition syndromes (e.g., <GeneName>DICER1</GeneName> for pleuropulmonary blastoma, <GeneName>SMARCB1</GeneName> and <GeneName>SMARCA4</GeneName> for rhabdoid tumor and small cell ovarian cancer, <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> for adrenocortical carcinoma and Li-Fraumeni syndrome cancers, <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> for retinoblastoma, etc.). The germline contribution to the development of specific cancers is discussed in the disease-specific sections that follow. </Para><Para id="_27">Each section of this document is meant to provide readers with a brief summary of current knowledge about the genomic landscape of specific childhood cancers, an understanding that is critical in considering how to apply precision medicine concepts to childhood cancers.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="25043047">Northcott PA, Lee C, Zichner T, et al.: Enhancer hijacking activates GFI1 family oncogenes in medulloblastoma.

The V600E variant of <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> leads to continuous phosphorylation, and thus activation, of MEK and ERK without the need for an external signal. Activation of ERK occurs by phosphorylation, and phosphorylated ERK can be detected in virtually all LCH lesions.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_sm_CDR0000778295_528">In a mouse model of LCH, the <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> V600E variant was shown to inhibit a chemokine receptor (CCR7)–mediated migration of dendritic cells, forcing them to accumulate in the LCH lesion.<Reference refidx="14"/> This variant also causes an increased expression of BCL2L1, which results in resistance to apoptosis.

The miRNA processing pathway is commonly mutated in Wilms tumor. Expression of mature miRNA is initiated by RNA polymerase–mediated transcription of DNA-encoded sequences into pri-miRNA, which form a long double-stranded hairpin. This structure is then cleaved by a complex of Drosha and DGCR8 into a smaller pre-miRNA hairpin, which is exported from the nucleus and then cleaved by Dicer (an RNase) and TRBP (with specificity for dsRNA) to remove the hairpin loop and leave two single-stranded miRNAs. The functional strand binds to Argonaute (Ago2) proteins into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where it guides the complex to its target mRNA, while the nonfunctional strand is degraded. Targeting of mRNAs by this method results in mRNA silencing by mRNA cleavage, translational repression, or deadenylation. Let-7 miRNAs are a family of miRNAs highly expressed in ESCs with tumor suppressor properties. In cases in which LIN28 is overexpressed, LIN28 binds to pre-Let-7 miRNA, preventing DICER from binding and resulting in LIN28-activated polyuridylation by TUT4 or TUT7, causing reciprocal DIS3L2-mediated degradation of Let-7 pre-miRNAs. Genes involved in miRNA processing that have been associated with Wilms tumor are highlighted in blue (inactivating) and green (activating) and include DROSHA, DGCR8, XPO5 (encoding exportin-5), DICER1, TARBP2, DIS3L2, and LIN28.
