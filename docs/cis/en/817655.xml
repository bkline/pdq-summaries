As a result, in certain cases, patients may elect to postpone treatment until its effects on the pregnancy are minimized.  This approach may be considered for patients with the more common and less aggressive histological subtypes: squamous, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous.  Patients with high-risk subtypes, such as small cell or neuroendocrine tumors, should consider immediate treatment despite the effects on the fetus, given their risk of progression.</Para><Para id="_828">Patients with early-stage disease (IA) may safely undergo fertility-sparing treatments, including cervical conization or radical trachelectomy, as indicated.  The optimal timing for this procedure is in the second trimester, before fetal viability.  Some authors have suggested waiting until the completion of pregnancy to initiate treatment.<Reference refidx="1"/>  For patients with stages IA2 and IB disease, such a delay may be safe, but lymph node status should first be assessed because of  a risk of lymphatic spread.  The status  is best determined surgically via a laparoscopic or open lymph-node dissection, which can be safely performed up to approximately 20 weeks of pregnancy.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> Patients without lymphatic spread can wait for fetal viability before initiating treatment.  Patients with positive lymph nodes should consider immediate treatment.</Para><SummarySection id="_TrialSearch_826_sid_3"><Title>Current Clinical Trials</Title><Para id="_TrialSearch_826_22">Use our <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced">advanced clinical trial search</ExternalRef> to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

This treatment is toxic to the fetus and, without ovarian transposition, will render the ovaries nonfunctional after treatment.  Evacuation of the fetus should be performed before radiation therapy is initiated.

Mild growth restriction of the fetus is the most common side effect. Restriction of fetal growth  has been reported in a relatively small number of patients, and data are lacking on long-term outcomes for these women. As a result, this strategy should be considered with caution.   Most of the patients in the reports underwent standard treatment (either surgery or radiation therapy) after completion of the pregnancy.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="22325661">Morice P, Uzan C, Gouy S, et al.: Gynaecological cancers in pregnancy.
