The bladder is a hollow, balloon-shaped organ in the lower part of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045070" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">abdomen</GlossaryTermRef> that stores urine. </Para><Para id="_3">The bladder has a muscular wall that allows it to get larger to store urine made by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046325" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">kidneys</GlossaryTermRef> and to shrink to squeeze urine out of the body. There are two kidneys, one on each side of the backbone, above the waist.
