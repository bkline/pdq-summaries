Concerns about the prevalence of opioid misuse have drawn increasing attention to how opioids are prescribed in common settings, including postoperatively.  Studies suggest widespread variation in the prescribing patterns of opioids in the postoperative setting.<Reference refidx="15"/>  One study of opioid use after orthopedic and general surgery procedures found that, on average, only between 19% and 34% of the opioids prescribed were used and that the quantity of opioids prescribed after a given procedure varied widely by provider.<Reference refidx="15"/> This finding led to the evaluation of utilization data and recommendations for standardizing the quantity of opioids prescribed for five common general surgery procedures.<Reference refidx="16"/> An educational intervention based on those recommendations was associated with a 53% decrease in prescribed opioids after those five general surgery procedures, with only 1 patient in a cohort of 246 patients requiring an opioid refill.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_362">The opioid epidemic has also raised questions about whether postoperative use of opioids can lead to misuse.  New, persistent opioid use  develops in 6% to 8% of patients who have never used opioids after noncancer surgery.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>  In a large retrospective analysis of patients undergoing curative-intent cancer surgery, 10.4% of opioid-naïve patients developed new persistent opioid use, defined as filling opioid prescriptions 90 to 180 days after surgery.  At 1 year postsurgery, these patients were using an average of six 5-mg hydrocodone (or equivalent) tablets per day.  Among the risk factors evaluated, only the use of adjuvant chemotherapy increased the risk of new persistent opioid use  (15%–21% risk with adjuvant chemotherapy vs. 7%–11% risk with no chemotherapy).<Reference refidx="21"/>  In summary, one in ten patients undergoing curative-intent cancer surgery may be at risk of  postoperative persistent opioid use.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_240"><Title>Infusion-related pain syndromes</Title><Para id="_241">The infusion of intravenous chemotherapy    causes four pain syndromes:<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_429" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Venous spasm, which is treated by the application of a warm compress or a decrease in the infusion rate.</ListItem><ListItem>Chemical phlebitis, which may result from chemotherapy or  nonchemotherapy infusions such as potassium chloride and  hyperosmolar solutions.<Reference refidx="23"/></ListItem><ListItem>Vesicant extravasation, which may cause intense pain followed by desquamation and ulceration.<Reference refidx="22"/></ListItem><ListItem>Anthracycline-associated flare, a venous flare reaction that may be caused by doxorubicin and includes local urticaria, pain, or stinging.<Reference refidx="24"/> </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_430">Some chemotherapy agents, such as vinorelbine, may cause pain at the tumor site.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_242"><Title>Treatment-related mucositis</Title><Para id="_243">Severe mucositis  often occurs as a consequence of myeloablative chemotherapy and  standard-intensity therapy.<Reference refidx="26"/> Cytotoxic agents commonly associated with mucositis are cytarabine, doxorubicin, etoposide, fluorouracil (5-FU), and methotrexate. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors also cause mucositis.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/> Risk factors for mucositis include preexisting oral pathology, poor dental hygiene, and younger age.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_369"><Title>White blood cell growth factor–related bone pain</Title><Para id="_370">Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim are recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) that increase proliferation and differentiation of neutrophil precursors. Ostealgia is a significant adverse effect caused by G-CSFs that can occur in 20% to 71% of patients.<Reference refidx="29"/> This bone pain starts within 2 days of a pegfilgrastim dose and lasts for 2 to 4 days. Although the mechanism by which G-CSFs cause bone pain is largely unknown, it is hypothesized that histamine release, creating local inflammation and edema, may play a role. A phase II trial randomly assigned patients who had experienced bone pain with pegfilgrastim to receive either daily loratadine 10 mg for 7 days or a matching placebo after subsequent doses of pegfilgrastim.<Reference refidx="30"/> There was no statistically significant difference between the two arms.</Para><Para id="_395">A second phase II trial randomly assigned patients receiving pegfilgrastim to receive naproxen, loratadine, or no preventative medications.<Reference refidx="31"/>  The percentage of patients experiencing any grade bone pain was 40.3% in the naproxen group, 42.5% in the loratadine group, and 46.6% in the no-prophylaxis group. Although there was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups, the authors concluded that loratadine administration has a favorable risk-to-benefit profile and should be considered.</Para><Para id="_396">Conventional pain medications have also been studied in this area. A phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of naproxen for the prevention of pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain randomly assigned patients to receive either naproxen 500 mg twice daily for 5 to 8 days after pegfilgrastim administration or a placebo.<Reference refidx="32"/> Naproxen reduced overall pain intensity and duration of pain, compared with placebo.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_244"><Title>Chemotherapy-related musculoskeletal pain</Title><Para id="_245">Paclitaxel generates a syndrome of diffuse arthralgias and myalgias in 10% to 20% of patients.<Reference refidx="33"/> Diffuse pain in joints and muscles  appears  1 to 2 days after the infusion and lasts a median of 4 to 5 days. Pain originates in the back, hips, shoulders, thighs, legs, and feet. Weight bearing, walking, or tactile contact exacerbates the pain. Steroids may reduce the tendency to develop myalgia and arthralgias.

First, patients may experience pain from brachytherapy and from positioning during treatment (i.e., placement on a radiation treatment table). Second, delayed tissue damage such as mucositis, mucosal inflammation in areas receiving radiation, and dermatitis may be painful. Third, a temporary worsening of pain in the treated area (a pain flare) is a potential side effect of radiation treatment for bone metastases.<Reference refidx="43"/> A randomized trial demonstrated that dexamethasone (8 mg on the day of radiation therapy and daily for the following 4 days) reduces the incidence of pain flares, compared with placebo.<Reference refidx="44"/> For more information, see  the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062738#_174" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-hp-pdq">External-Beam Radiation Therapy</SummaryRef> section.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_237"><Title>Impact on Function and QOL</Title><Para id="_238">Cancer pain is associated with increased emotional distress.

Pain receptors are found in somatic (e.g., cutaneous, bone) and visceral tissues. The amount of visceral sensory innervation and the diffusion of visceral pain signals within the brain explain the difficulty experienced by patients in describing or localizing visceral pain compared with somatic pain. A specific type of visceral pain is referred pain, which is explained by the commingling of nerve fibers from somatic and visceral nociceptors at the level of the spinal cord. Patients mistakenly interpret the pain as originating from the innervated somatic tissue. Visceral pain may be accompanied by autonomic signs such as sweating, pallor, or bradycardia. Somatic pain is more easily localized.</Para><Para id="_35"><Strong>Neuropathic pain</Strong> is pain caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system or the CNS (spinal cord or brain). Causes of neuropathic pain of particular relevance to cancer include chemotherapy (e.g., vinca alkaloids), infiltration of the nerve roots by tumor, or damage to nerve roots (radiculopathy) or groups of nerve roots (plexopathy) due to tumor masses or treatment complications (e.g., radiation plexopathy).<Reference refidx="8"/> The pain may be evoked by stimuli or spontaneous. Patients who experience pain from nonnoxious stimuli are classified as having allodynia. Hyperalgesia connotes increased sensations of pain out of proportion to what is usually experienced.</Para><Para id="_290">Emotional distress may also contribute to the pain experience.  Most patients with cancer and pain do not have somatic symptom disorder.  However, if pain complaints appear to be disproportionate to the underlying pain stimulus, it is important to evaluate for psychological and existential distress contributing to the pain complaint, chemical coping, and substance use disorder.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_36"><Title>Acute and Chronic Cancer Pain</Title><Para id="_37">Pain is often classified as either acute or chronic or by how it varies over time with terms such as  breakthrough, persistent, or incidental. Acute pain is typically induced by tissue injury, begins suddenly with the injury, and diminishes over time with tissue healing. There is no definite length but, in general, acute pain resolves within 3 to 6 months.<Reference refidx="9"/> The treatment of acute pain focuses on blocking nociceptive pathways while the tissue heals.</Para><Para id="_38">Chronic pain typically persists even after the injury has healed, although patients with chronic joint disease, for example, may have ongoing tissue damage and therefore experience chronic pain. Pain becomes chronic when it:<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_432" Style="bullet">

Chronic pain involves the activation of secondary mechanisms such as the sensitization of second-order neurons by upregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid channels and alteration in microglia cytoarchitecture. Chronic pain, with its multiple factors for perpetuation, often benefits from a multidisciplinary approach to treatment.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_39"><Title>Breakthrough Pain</Title><Para id="_40">In caring for patients with pain, <Strong>breakthrough pain</Strong>  is distinguished from <Strong>background pain</Strong>.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/> Breakthrough pain is a transitory increase or flare of pain in the setting of relatively well-controlled acute or chronic pain.<Reference refidx="12"/> Incident pain is a type of breakthrough pain related to certain often-defined activities or factors such as movement increasing vertebral body pain from metastatic disease. It is often difficult to treat such pain effectively because of its episodic nature.<Reference refidx="13"/> In one study, 75% of patients experienced breakthrough pain; 30% of this pain was incidental, 26% was nonincidental, 16% was caused by end-of-dose failure, and the rest had mixed etiologies.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Richmond C: Dame Cicely Saunders.

Evaluation of pain intensity at each visit would allow clinicians to monitor for changes and treatment response.  Pain intensity scales can also be used to develop a personalized pain goal (PPG).<Reference refidx="4"/> A PPG is a patient’s self-reported pain management goal on a scale of 0 to 10 and is used to identify the maximum pain intensity that the patient considers tolerable.<Reference refidx="5"/>   The PPG is a relatively simple tool with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 77% when used for measuring pain relief.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_503">Patient-reported symptoms and clinician-assessed pain reporting may not be concordant, and discrepancies in assessment or interpretation of symptoms can be important in making decisions about cancer treatment. In one study, breast cancer patients who were undergoing an exercise intervention and who received four different chemotherapy regimens (e.g., anthracycline- and paclitaxel-based regimens) were assessed for symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) by patient self-report (the Patient-Reported Symptom Monitoring form, a five-point symptom scale) and by clinician assessment (the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events form, a five-point adverse event rating scale).<Reference refidx="7"/> Patient-reported pain symptoms were compared for concordance with clinician-assessed adverse events, and there was minimal agreement (weighted Cohen kappa, 0.34) between patient-reported and clinician-assessed CIPN toxicity scores. The discrepancy between patient-reported and clinician-assessed CIPN underscores the need for both patient and clinician perspectives regarding this common and potentially disabling toxicity of chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer. Treatment changes and reduced doses of anthracycline- and paclitaxel-based regimens could be driven by the inclusion of patient-reported symptoms, which may serve as a better indicator of CIPN toxicities.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_44"><Title>Clinician Assessment</Title><Para id="_256">Failure to assess pain adequately leads to undertreatment. Assessment involves both clinician observation and patient report. The goal of the initial pain assessment is to characterize the pathophysiology of the pain and to determine the intensity of the pain and its impact on the patient’s ability to function. It is important to recognize that psychosocial issues can either exacerbate or ameliorate the experience of pain.<Reference refidx="8"/> These psychosocial issues cannot be easily treated through pharmacological approaches; therefore, it is critical that clinicians include these in initial and subsequent examinations of patients with pain to ensure referrals to appropriate treatment resources. Furthermore, distinct cultural components may need to be incorporated into a multidimensional assessment of pain, including how culture influences the pain experience,  pain communication, and provider response to pain expression.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_257">Identifying the etiology of pain is important for its management. Clinicians treating patients with cancer need to recognize the common cancer pain syndromes.

In a review of 1,612 patients referred to an outpatient palliative care center, more than half of patients with moderate to severe pain did not show pain relief (a reduction in 2 out of 10 points or  a 30% decrease on the pain scale) after the initial palliative care consultation.<Reference refidx="13"/> In addition, one-third of patients with mild pain progressed to moderate to severe pain by the time of their first follow-up visit. The study also identified baseline pain intensity, fatigue, and Edmonton Symptom Assessment System symptom burden as factors predicting response.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_232">Ideally, comprehensive pain assessment includes a discussion about the patient’s goals and expectations for pain management. This conversation may lead to a fruitful discussion about  balancing pain levels and other patient goals, such as mental alertness. Comprehensive pain assessment also includes pain history, pain intensity, quality of pain, and location of pain.  For each pain location,  the pattern of pain radiation is assessed.  Also important is provider awareness of the patient’s current pain management treatment plan and how the patient has responded to treatment, including how adequately the current treatment plan addresses any breakthrough or episodic pain. A full assessment also reviews previously attempted pain therapies and reasons for discontinuation;  other associated symptoms such as sleep difficulties, fatigue, depression, and anxiety; functional impairment; and any relevant laboratory data and diagnostic imaging.  A focused physical examination includes clinical observation of pain behaviors, pain location, and functional limitations.</Para><Para id="_233">Psychosocial and existential factors that can affect pain are also assessed and appropriately treated.  Depression and anxiety can have a large influence on the pain experience.   Across many different types of pain, research has shown the importance of considering a patient’s sense of self-efficacy over their pain: low self-efficacy, or focus on solely pharmacological solutions, is likely to increase the use of pain medication.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/> In addition, the psychological strategy of <Strong>catastrophizing</Strong>, an irrational thinking pattern that the outcome of any experience will always be significantly worse than what is the most likely outcome, has consistently been shown to escalate pain.   Patients who repeatedly catastrophize pain (e.g., patient reports pain higher than 10 on a 10-point scale [“My pain is a 12!”] or believes that every minor, nonspecific symptom indicates a cancer recurrence <Reference refidx="16"/>) are more likely to require higher doses of medication than are patients who do not catastrophize.  Catastrophizing is strongly associated with low self-efficacy and greater reliance on chemical coping strategies.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>
 Furthermore, assessing the impact of pain on the individual’s life and associated factors that exacerbate or relieve pain can reveal how psychosocial issues are affecting the patient’s pain levels.</Para><Para id="_234">A pain assessment includes a review of any patient and family history of substance use and the extent of the patient’s chemical coping strategies before and since the cancer diagnosis. The extent of chemical coping strategies, including reliance on legal substances (e.g., nicotine, alcohol, and sleeping pills), may indicate a history of reliance on chemicals to alleviate distress. It can also provide the clinician with information about the patient’s nicotine use, which may affect how certain opioids may be differentially metabolized and the amount of opioids required to achieve pain control.<Reference refidx="21"/> A remote history of substance use disorder can still affect current pain levels and analgesic requirements. Remote substance use may have long-term implications for pain sensitivity, even if the patient has a history of prolonged abstinence from opioid use.<Reference refidx="22"/> Together, personal and family substance use can inform a risk assessment for  potential  abuse of medications, potential analgesic requirements, and diversion of prescriptions.</Para><Para id="_576">Patients may experience pain and other symptoms at the same time during and after treatment. Symptoms that occur together over time may form a cluster.

Specifically, a high baseline pain intensity, neuropathic pain, and incident pain are often more difficult to manage.<Reference refidx="23"/> Furthermore, several patient characteristics are associated with higher pain expression, higher opioid doses, and longer time to achieve pain control. These characteristics include a personal or family history of the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_469" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Illicit drug use.<Reference refidx="24"/></ListItem><ListItem>Alcohol use disorder.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/></ListItem><ListItem>Smoking.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/></ListItem><ListItem>Somatization.<Reference refidx="29"/></ListItem><ListItem>Mental health issues such as depression or anxiety.<Reference refidx="30"/></ListItem><ListItem> Cognitive dysfunction.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_258">Based on these predictive factors, several risk scores have been developed to assist clinicians, such as the Edmonton Classification System for Cancer Pain (ECS-CP) <Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="34"/> and the Cancer Pain Prognostic Scale (CPPS).<Reference refidx="35"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_259" Style="bullet">

Individuals may hide pain from family members to avoid burdening them.

Referral to a pain specialist or a palliative care team may be indicated.</Strong></Para><Para id="_70">Methadone is both a mu-receptor agonist  and an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. It can be given via multiple routes (oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, and rectal); has a long half-life (13–58 hours) and rapid onset of action; and is inexpensive, making it an attractive option for cancer pain control. Because of its NMDA properties, methadone may be particularly useful for the management of opioid-induced neurotoxicity, hyperalgesia, and neuropathic pain, although further studies are needed to confirm these theoretical benefits. Methadone is safer than other opioids for patients with renal dysfunction, given that it is minimally renally excreted. It is preferred for those with known opioid allergies because it is a synthetic opioid. Additionally, it is long acting, whether given in crushed or liquid form, an important benefit when patients require drug administration via enteral tubes. However, methadone also has several distinct disadvantages, including drug interactions, the risk of QT prolongation, and a variable equianalgesic ratio, making rotation more challenging.</Para><Para id="_71">Methadone is metabolized by CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. The principal enzyme responsible for methadone levels and drug clearance is CYP2B6.<Reference refidx="32"/>  CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., certain anticonvulsants and antiretroviral agents) can potentially reduce its analgesic effect.<Reference refidx="33"/> In contrast, enzyme inhibitors may increase methadone’s activity, including side effects. For clinicians, the potential for significant drug-drug interactions may mean that some medications need to be replaced and that patients need extra monitoring. Furthermore, because methadone is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, medications that inhibit the activity of this transporter, such as verapamil and quinidine, may increase methadone’s bioavailability.</Para><Para id="_72">Methadone is associated with QT prolongation. This risk increases in patients receiving high doses (especially &gt;100 mg/day) or with preexisting risk factors, including treatment with some anticancer agents.  For patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, it is important to conduct a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) before treatment with methadone. A follow-up ECG is recommended at 2 to 4 weeks after methadone initiation if the patient has known risk factors, with the occurrence of new risk factor(s) for all patients, and  when the doses of methadone reach 30 to 40 mg/day and 100 mg/day for all patients regardless of risk, if consistent with goals of care.<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="34"/></Para><Para id="_73">Because the equianalgesic ratio between methadone and other opioids is unpredictable, most health care professionals recommend starting at a low dose  twice daily, with gradual dose escalation every 3 to 5 days or at longer intervals.<Reference refidx="32"/> Short-acting opioids, not methadone, should also be available for breakthrough pain.

A retrospective study was conducted in patients with advanced cancer who received palliative care consultations at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center;. The researchers sought to determine the frequency of and risk factors for OIN in 390 patients who had been taking opioids for 24 hours or longer.<Reference refidx="47"/> A board-certified palliative care specialist diagnosed OIN using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale.  Symptoms were attributed to OIN if a patient had no past medical history of that symptom; the differential diagnosis of other causes was excluded; and/or the symptoms improved upon discontinuation, decrease, or change in opioid dose.  The authors found that 15% of the patients developed at least one symptom of OIN, the most common of which was delirium (47%).  The mean morphine equivalent daily dose was 106 mg in patients without OIN and 181 mg in patients with OIN.

OIH is also defined as “the need for increasingly high levels of opioids to maintain pain inhibition after repeated drug exposure.” OIH is a clinical phenomenon that has been differentiated from opioid tolerance in the research literature in a mouse model.<Reference refidx="54"/></Para><Para id="_510">The clinical relevance needs to be further studied, and this issue may be underappreciated in clinical practice.</Para><Para id="_511">A thorough history and physical are appropriate if OIH is suspected.  Changes in pain perception and increasing opioid requirements may be caused by OIH, opioid tolerance, or disease progression.  There is no standard recommendation for the diagnosis and treatment of OIH.  A trial of incremental opioid dose reductions may lead to an improvement in pain from OIH. However, this may be psychologically distressing to oncology patients who require opioid treatment.  Opioid rotation is a strategy frequently employed if opioid tolerance has occurred.  Methadone is an ideal opioid to switch to, given its mechanism of action as an opioid receptor agonist and NMDA receptor antagonist.  Given the similarities between OIH and neuropathic pain,  the addition of an adjunctive medication such as pregabalin has been recommended.<Reference refidx="42"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_83"><Title>Respiratory depression</Title><Para id="_84">Opioid-induced respiratory depression may be caused by a blunting of the chemoreceptive response to carbon dioxide and oxygen levels and altered mechanical function of the lungs necessary for efficient ventilation and gas exchange.<Reference refidx="57"/> Opioid-induced respiratory depression may manifest through decreased respiratory rate, hypoxemia, or increases in total exhaled carbon dioxide.<Reference refidx="58"/> The prevalence of respiratory depression is not known but rarely occurs with proper opioid use and titration.<Reference refidx="59"/><Reference refidx="60"/><Reference refidx="61"/><Reference refidx="62"/> The following factors contribute to opioid-induced respiratory depression:</Para><ItemizedList id="_438" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Obstructive sleep apnea.</ListItem><ListItem>Obesity.</ListItem><ListItem>Concomitant sedating medications.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_85">If respiratory depression is thought to be related to opioids (e.g., in conjunction with pinpoint pupils and sedation), naloxone, a nonselective competitive opioid antagonist, may be useful. However, careful titration should be considered because it may compromise pain control and may precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals. Because of methadone’s long half-life, naloxone infusion may be required for respiratory depression caused by methadone. For patients receiving opioids at home, nasal naloxone is indicated, particularly for those at greatest risk of respiratory depression, or if there is a concern about misuse or accidental use by others in the household.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_86"><Title>Nausea and vomiting</Title><Para id="_87">Opioid-induced nausea occurs in up to two-thirds of patients receiving opioids, and half of these patients will experience vomiting.<Reference refidx="63"/> Opioids cause nausea and vomiting via enhanced vestibular sensitivity, via direct effects on the chemoreceptor trigger zone, and by causing delayed gastric emptying.<Reference refidx="64"/> Antiemetics may be started up front in patients at risk of developing nausea or instituted once symptoms occur.  Tolerance to opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV) may develop, and symptoms should resolve within 1 week.  If symptoms persist despite treatment with antiemetics, opioid rotation can be considered, or other causes of nausea can be investigated.</Para><Para id="_88">OINV is treated with many of the same antiemetic drugs that are used for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.  Although many antiemetic regimens have been proposed for OINV, there is no current standard.<Reference refidx="64"/> The chemoreceptor trigger zone is stimulated by dopamine, serotonin, and histamine.  Metoclopramide may be a particularly attractive option because of its dual antiemetic and prokinetic effects.  Other dopamine antagonists such as prochlorperazine, promethazine, and olanzapine have been used to treat OINV. For patients whose nausea worsens with positional changes, a scopolamine patch has been found effective.  Serotonin antagonists such as ondansetron may be used.

Opioids act on opioid receptors in the hypothalamus, decreasing the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone.<Reference refidx="72"/> This results in a decreased release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, and finally a reduction of testosterone and estradiol released from the gonads.

Patient preference, history of opioid use, route of administration, and cost are necessary considerations before the final choice is made.</Para><Para id="_521">A study of opioid rotation in the outpatient palliative care setting revealed that approximately one-third of 385 consecutive patients needed an opioid rotation, mostly for uncontrolled pain (83%) and OIN (12%).<Reference refidx="84"/> The success rate was 65%, with a median pain improvement of two points out of ten (minimal clinically important difference is one point).<Reference refidx="85"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_522"><Title>Barriers related to opioid use</Title><Para id="_523">The barriers to appropriate use of opioids in the treatment of cancer pain include misunderstanding or misapprehension about opioids by health care providers, patients, and society. One group of investigators surveyed 93 patients with cancer cared for in an academic practice in Australia to understand patient-level concerns about the use of opioids.<Reference refidx="86"/> One-third of the patients reported high levels of pain that adversely affected activity, mood, sleep, and enjoyment of life.  High percentages of patients reported concerns about addiction (76%) or side effects (67%). In addition, patients expressed concerns that the pain represented disease progression (71%), that they were distracting the doctor (49%), or that they would not be seen as a “good patient” (46%).<Reference refidx="86"/> Patients with more severe pain were more likely to express concerns about side effects and were less likely to use unconventional approaches to control pain. Results were similar to those of a survey of American patients from the previous decade.<Reference refidx="87"/></Para><Para id="_524">Physician-perceived barriers to opioid prescribing tend to parallel those of patients.<Reference refidx="88"/> For example, physicians and other health care providers have beliefs about addiction that inhibit prescribing. For some, these beliefs are informed by guidelines and data extrapolated from a noncancer population. Guidelines influence physician prescribing and, at times, may be applied to populations who are not addressed in a guideline. For instance, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its guideline on prescribing opioids for chronic noncancer pain in 2016,<Reference refidx="89"/> the mean number of opioids prescribed by oncologists per 100 Medicare beneficiaries  decreased by 22.2%, from 69.0 in 2013 to 53.7 in 2017. This effect was widespread, with decreased prescribing noted in 43 of 50 U.S. states.<Reference refidx="90"/> These changes in prescribing patterns resulted in decreases in frequency, dose, and duration of opioid prescriptions for U.S. patients with cancer-related pain.<Reference refidx="91"/> In a large study of Medicare patients with poor prognoses,  a decrease in opioid prescribing from 2007 to 2017 was correlated with an increase in emergency department visits near the end of life. This finding raises concerns about undertreated pain in this population.<Reference refidx="92"/></Para><Para id="_548">Similarly, a cohort study in a pediatric population compared opioid prescription rates for 8,969 privately insured pediatric cancer survivors who were 1 year off therapy (aged ≤21 years at diagnosis) and 44,845 matched peers without cancer during the time before (7 years) and after (2 years) the CDC opioid prescribing guideline. Indicators chosen for "potential misuse" were 1) high daily opioid dose (≥100 MMEs daily), 2) multiple opioid prescription overlap of 7 or more days, 3) opioid and benzodiazepine overlap of 7 or more days, or 4) opioid dose escalation (≥50% increase in monthly average MME twice per year). Relative reduction in opioid prescription rates were 36.7% in survivors versus 15.9% in peers without cancer. Relative reduction in the rate of potential misuse and substance use disorder was 65.4% in survivors and 29.9% in peers without cancer. These findings raise concerns that the guideline affected access to opioid-based strategies for pain control for pediatric patients with cancer and during survivorship.<Reference refidx="93"/></Para><Para id="_525">Racial inequities are also seen in opioid prescribing. They worsened between 2007 and 2019 and disproportionately affected Black men.  A study evaluated 318,549 non-Hispanic White, Black, and Hispanic Medicare-covered decedents older than 65 years with poor-prognosis cancers. It demonstrated that Black and Hispanic patients were less likely to receive any opioid (Black, -4.3 percentage points, 95% confidence Interval (CI), -4.8 to -3.6; Hispanic, -3.6 percentage points, 95% CI, -4.4 to -2.9), received lower daily doses (Black, -10.5 MMEs per day [MMED], 95% CI, -12.8 to -8.2; Hispanic, -9.1 MMED, 95% CI, -12.1 to -6.1), and lower total doses (Black, -210 MMEs, 95% CI, -293 to -207; Hispanic, -179 MMEs, 95% CI, -217 to -142). Black patients were also more likely to undergo urine drug screening (0.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3–0.8). Adjustment for socioeconomic factors did not attenuate the end-of-life opioid access disparities.<Reference refidx="94"/> In a study that evaluated patients with head and neck cancer who received care from 2017 to 2021,  White patients were significantly more likely than non-White patients to receive a new prescription for pain (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.52; 95% CI, 1.09–5.86), despite no statistically significant difference in odds of pain reporting between the groups (adjusted OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.73–1.30).<Reference refidx="95"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>] </Para><Para id="_562">Many states have developed prescription drug monitoring programs, and the FDA requires <ExternalRef xref="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/rems/index.cfm">REMS</ExternalRef>  (a risk evaluation and management strategy) for certain opioids, such as rapid-onset fentanyl products.

Because many different types of urine drug tests are available, clinicians may want to become familiar with the types and interpretation of tests available locally. Awareness of false-positive and false-negative results is crucial to accurate interpretation.<Reference refidx="113"/> A clinician’s laboratory can identify the substance in question. Clinicians use urine drug testing differently, with some requiring it at the initiation of therapy, episodically, or at the transition to long-term opioid therapy. Risk assessment helps to determine  frequency of urine drug testing.<Reference refidx="112"/></Para><Para id="_135">Pharmacological deterrence has emerged as another option  designed to dissuade misuse and abuse by making it difficult to obtain euphoric effects from opioid use.<Reference refidx="112"/> Creating barriers to increasing the bioavailability of opioids is one method of pharmacological deterrence.

Instead, they bind to the alpha2delta-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which may result in decreased neuronal excitability in pain-associated sensory neurons. These drugs have been widely studied in the treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes and as adjunctive agents with opioids.

Doses of both agents need to be adjusted for patients with renal dysfunction.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="116"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_375"><Title>Venlafaxine and duloxetine</Title><Para id="_376">The antidepressant medications venlafaxine and duloxetine  have demonstrated some efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes. Venlafaxine and duloxetine are serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors originally approved for depression; however, both are used off-label for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). In addition, duloxetine is indicated for musculoskeletal pain. Both serotonin and norepinephrine have important roles in analgesia.</Para><Para id="_377">Common dosing for duloxetine ranges from 30 to 60 mg per day.

Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, somnolence, and hypertension at higher doses. These effects decrease with the use of the long-acting formulations. Venlafaxine is used with caution in patients with bipolar disorder or a history of seizures and is dose-adjusted for patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. If the decision is made to discontinue either venlafaxine or duloxetine, a slow tapering course may help to minimize withdrawal symptoms.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_380"><Title>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)</Title><Para id="_381">The TCAs amitriptyline, desipramine, and nortriptyline are used to treat many neuropathic pain syndromes.

Because of these adverse effects and drug interactions, TCAs are used with caution in older patients, patients with seizure disorders, and those with preexisting cardiac disease.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_383"><Title>Corticosteroids</Title><Para id="_384">There is a lack of high-quality data demonstrating the efficacy of corticosteroids in treating cancer pain.  A systematic review of the literature resulted in four randomized controlled trials and concluded that there is low-grade evidence to suggest corticosteroids have moderate activity in the treatment of cancer pain.<Reference refidx="119"/> A small but well-designed study showed no benefit to adding corticosteroids to opioid analgesia in the short term (7 days).<Reference refidx="120"/></Para><Para id="_385">Despite the lack of good evidence, corticosteroids are often used in the clinical setting. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisone) may be used as adjuvant analgesics for cancer pain originating in bone, neuropathy, and malignant intestinal obstruction.  Mechanisms of analgesic action include decreased inflammation, decreased peritumoral edema, and modulation of neural activity and plasticity.<Reference refidx="121"/></Para><Para id="_386">Although there is no established corticosteroid dose in this setting, recommendations range from a trial of low-dose therapy such as dexamethasone 1 mg to 2 mg or prednisone 5 mg to 10 mg once or twice daily,<Reference refidx="122"/> to dexamethasone 10 mg twice daily.<Reference refidx="123"/> A randomized trial demonstrated that dexamethasone (8 mg on day of radiation therapy and daily for the following 4 days) reduces the incidence of pain flares, compared with placebo.<Reference refidx="124"/> For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062738#_174" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-hp-pdq">External-Beam Radiation Therapy</SummaryRef> section.</Para><Para id="_477">The immediate side effects of corticosteroid use include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_455" Style="bullet">

If taken for more than 3 weeks, corticosteroids are tapered upon improvement in pain, if possible.  If corticosteroids are to be continued long term, anti-infective prophylaxis can be considered. Dexamethasone is preferred because it has reduced mineralocorticoid effects, resulting in reduced fluid retention; however, it does exhibit cytochrome P450–mediated drug interactions.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_387"><Title>Bisphosphonates and denosumab</Title><Para id="_388">The bisphosphonate class of drugs inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption, decreasing bone pain and skeletal-related events associated with cancer that has metastasized to the bone. Pamidronate and zoledronic acid decrease cancer-related bone pain, decrease analgesic use, and improve quality of life in patients with bone metastases.<Reference refidx="125"/><Reference refidx="126"/><Reference refidx="127"/><Reference refidx="128"/>  American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines for the use of these bone-modifying agents in patients with breast cancer and myeloma specify they should  be used not as monotherapy, but as part of a treatment regimen that includes analgesics and nonpharmacological interventions.<Reference refidx="129"/><Reference refidx="130"/>  Bisphosphonates can cause an acute phase reaction characterized by fever, flu-like symptoms, arthralgia, and myalgia that may last for up to 3 days after administration.  Additional adverse effects include renal toxicity, electrolyte imbalances, and osteonecrosis of the jaw.<Reference refidx="131"/><Reference refidx="132"/><Reference refidx="133"/>  Doses are adjusted for patients with renal dysfunction.</Para><Para id="_389">A single dose of ibandronate 6 mg was compared with a single fraction of radiation for localized metastatic bone pain in 470 prostate cancer patients.<Reference refidx="134"/> Patients were allowed to cross over if they failed to respond at 4 weeks. Pain was assessed at 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Pain response was not statistically different between the two groups at 4 or 12 weeks; however, a faster onset of pain response was seen in the radiation therapy group. Interestingly, patients who crossed over and received both treatments had a longer overall survival than did patients who did not cross over. The authors concluded that ibandronate provides a feasible alternative to radiation therapy for the treatment of metastatic bone pain when radiation therapy is not an option.</Para><Para id="_390">Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL), prevents osteoclast precursor activation, and is primarily used in the treatment of bone metastases. A review of six trials comparing zoledronic acid with denosumab demonstrated a greater delay in time to worsening pain for denosumab (relative risk, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77–0.91).<Reference refidx="135"/></Para><Para id="_391">Compared with zoledronic acid, denosumab has similar adverse effects with less nephrotoxicity and increased hypocalcemia.  There is no adjustment for renal dysfunction; however, patients with a creatinine clearance lower than 30 mL/min are at a higher risk of developing hypocalcemia. Denosumab may be more convenient than zoledronic acid because it is a subcutaneous injection and not an intravenous infusion; however, it is significantly less cost-effective.<Reference refidx="136"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_392"><Title>Ketamine</Title><Para id="_393">Ketamine is an FDA-approved dissociative general anesthetic that has been used off-label in subanesthetic doses to treat opioid-refractory cancer pain. A 2012 Cochrane review of ketamine used as an adjuvant to opioids in the treatment of cancer pain concluded there is insufficient evidence to evaluate its efficacy in this setting.<Reference refidx="137"/></Para><Para id="_394">Lack of demonstrated clinical benefit, significant adverse events, and CYP3A4-associated drug interactions limit ketamine’s utility in the treatment of cancer pain. It is an NMDA receptor antagonist that, at low doses, produces analgesia, modulates central sensitization, and circumvents  opioid tolerance.  However, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of subcutaneous ketamine in patients with chronic uncontrolled cancer pain failed to show a net clinical benefit when ketamine was added to the patients’ opioid regimen.<Reference refidx="138"/> Adverse drug reactions include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_457" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Hypertension.</ListItem><ListItem>Tachycardia.</ListItem><ListItem>Psychotomimetic effects.</ListItem><ListItem>Increased intracranial and intraocular pressure.</ListItem><ListItem>Sedation.</ListItem><ListItem>Delirium.</ListItem><ListItem>Impaired bladder function.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_TrialSearch_58_sid_4"><Title>Current Clinical Trials</Title><Para id="_TrialSearch_58_22">Use our <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced">advanced clinical trial search</ExternalRef> to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.
