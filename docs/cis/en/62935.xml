in young women and adolescent girls. These tumors are frequently unilateral and are
generally curable if found and treated early.  The use of combination chemotherapy
after initial surgery has dramatically improved the prognosis for many women
with these tumors.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_188"><Title>Dysgerminomas</Title><Para id="_189">One series found a 10-year survival  rate of 88.6% following conservative surgery for patients with dysgerminoma confined to the ovary; smaller than 10 cm in size; with
an intact, smooth capsule unattached to other organs; and without ascites.<Reference refidx="4"/>  A
number of patients had one or more successful pregnancies following unilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Even patients with incompletely resected
dysgerminoma can be rendered disease free following chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP)
or a combination of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_190"><Title>Other Germ Cell Tumors</Title><Para id="_191">A report of 35 cases of germ cell tumors, half of which were
advanced stage or recurrent or progressive disease, demonstrated a 97%
sustained remission at 10 months to 54 months after the start of a combination of BEP.<Reference refidx="1"/> 
Two Gynecologic Oncology Group trials reported that
89 of 93 patients with stage I, II, or III disease who had completely
resected tumors were disease free after three cycles of BEP.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_192">Endodermal sinus tumors of the ovary are
particularly aggressive.  A review of the literature in 1979 prior to the
widespread use of combination chemotherapy found only 27% of 96 patients with
stage I endodermal sinus tumor alive at 2 years after diagnosis.  More than 50% of the patients died within a year
of diagnosis.</Para><Para id="_193">Patients with mature
teratomas usually experience long-term survival, but survival for patients with immature teratomas after surgery only is related to
the grade of the tumor, especially its neural elements.  In a series of 58
patients with immature teratoma treated before the modern chemotherapeutic era,
recurrence was reported in 18% of the patients with grade 1 disease, 37% of the patients with
grade 2 disease, and 70% of the patients with grade 3 disease.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Similar findings have
been reported by others.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_194">Some studies have found that size and histology were the major factors determining
prognosis for patients with malignant mixed germ cell tumors of the ovary.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="8"/> 
Prognosis was poor for patients with large tumors when more than one-third of the tumor was
composed of endodermal sinus elements, choriocarcinoma, or grade 3 immature
teratoma.  When the tumor was smaller than 10 cm in
diameter, the prognosis was good, regardless of the composition of the tumor.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8381708" MedlineID="93161293">Gershenson DM: Update on malignant ovarian germ cell tumors.

and its effectiveness in advanced-stage dysgerminoma, adjuvant chemotherapy is likely to be effective and to allow
recovery of reproductive potential in patients with an intact ovary, fallopian tube, and
uterus.  Thus, adjuvant chemotherapy with the combination of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) has replaced
radiation therapy except in the rare patient in whom chemotherapy is not
considered appropriate.
