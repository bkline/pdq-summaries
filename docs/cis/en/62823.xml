Estrogen, both endogenous and exogenous, is associated with endometrial proliferation, hyperplasia, and cancer.  Thus, risk factors include endometrial hyperplasia, reproductive factors (nulliparity, early menarche and late menopause), polycystic ovary syndrome, postmenopausal estrogen therapy, obesity with adult weight gain, and tamoxifen use. Women with Lynch     syndrome have an  increased risk of endometrial cancer, as do women who have a first-degree relative with endometrial cancer. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1"><Title>Overview</Title><Para id="_2">Note: The Overview section summarizes the published evidence on this topic.

However, for  individual episodes of breastfeeding, breastfeeding one child beyond 3 months was associated with a 5% reduction in risk (adjusted pooled OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91–0.99).<Reference refidx="3"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_283"><Title>Hormonal Contraceptives</Title><Para id="_308">Oral contraceptives were first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1960. For many years, they were the mainstay of hormonal contraception. More recently, hormonal contraception has expanded to include combination transdermal patches or vaginal rings, injections, and progestogen-releasing long-acting reversible contraceptives, including single-rod implants and intrauterine systems (IUS).<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_284">Oral contraceptive usage confers a long-term reduction in the risk of endometrial cancer.  A large population-based study from the United Kingdom prospectively collected information on combined oral contraception use for 46,022 women and followed them for 44 years. In this study, after adjusting for age, parity, smoking, and social class, ever-users of combined estrogen/progesterone oral contraceptive pills had an incidence rate ratio of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.48–0.89) compared with never-users.<Reference refidx="5"/> The benefit of oral contraceptive pill use is associated with duration of use, with increasing benefit reported for women who were obese, current smokers, and those who rarely exercise and who used oral contraceptives for 10 years or more.<Reference refidx="6"/> A meta-analysis combined data from 36 epidemiological studies that included 27,276 women. The study observed a risk reduction of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.73–0.78) for every 5 years of oral contraceptive use.  The lower risk  persisted for more than 30 years after the last use of oral contraceptives.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="7"/>   Among women from highly developed  countries, 10 years of oral contraceptive use was associated with an absolute risk reduction of endometrial cancer before age 75 years from 2.3 to 1.3 cases per 100 women.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_309">Data suggest that use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG-IUS) is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Use of LNG-IUS is an effective treatment for endometrial hyperplasia, which in some cases is a precursor to endometrial cancer and early-stage low-risk endometrial cancer.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> A population-based prospective cohort study in Norway evaluated a cohort of 104,380 women, which included 9,146 women who identified as ever-users of LNG-IUS. The incidence rate of endometrial cancer per 100,000 person-years was 13.9 for ever-users of LNG-IUS (95% CI, 7.8–23.0), compared with 70.0 (95% CI, 65.4–74.9) for never-users. After adjusting for age and menopausal status at the start of follow-up, BMI, physical activity level, use of oral contraceptive pills, and parity, the relative risk (RR) of endometrial cancer was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.13–0.40) for ever-users of LNG-IUS.<Reference refidx="11"/> In an observational nationwide cohort study from Finland, women using LNG-IUS for treatment of menorrhagia from 1994 to 2007 were identified from administrative registers and linked with the Finnish Cancer Registry.<Reference refidx="12"/> In this study, 93,843 users of LNG-IUS were followed for 855,324 women-years at risk. The standardized incidence ratio for endometrial cancer after at least one purchase of LNG-IUS was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.33–0.64; 37 observed cases compared with 80 expected cases). Although not statistically different, the standardized incidence ratio decreased further in women who had purchased two LNG-IUS (0.25; 95% CI, 0.05–0.73; 3 observed cases compared with 12 expected cases). These data represent an attempt to demonstrate a dose effect, as LNG-IUS are considered effective for 5 years.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_310"><Title>Weight Loss</Title><Para id="_311">While it is known that obesity is associated with increased endometrial cancer risk, only one study examines the potential benefit of intentional weight loss.  In the Iowa Women’s Health Study (IWHS) of 21,707 postmenopausal women,<Reference refidx="13"/>  participants completed a self-report questionnaire about intentional weight loss between ages 18 and 39 years, between ages 40 and 54 years, and after age 55 years. Multivariate models adjusting for age, BMI, and BMI<Superscript>2</Superscript> found no association between endometrial cancer incidence and intentional weight loss of at least 20 pounds (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.60–1.44). However, one study included 36,793 women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) cohort <Reference refidx="14"/> whose weight was measured at baseline and at 3-year follow-up and was combined with self-reported intentionality of weight loss. The analysis showed an association between intentional weight loss of 10 pounds or more and lower endometrial cancer incidence (multivariable-adjusted RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40–0.92).</Para><Para id="_312">Both of these analyses share substantial limitations. Missing covariate data resulted in excluding nearly 25% of participants from each study, and only small percentages of the remaining participants (17% IWHS/8% WHI) were classified into the <Strong>intentional weight loss</Strong> category. This resulted in very low numbers of endometrial cancer cases driving the analyses. Both studies used self-report to characterize intentionality of weight loss, which can lead to potential misclassification, although the retrospective nature of the questioning in the IWHS makes the problem more acute in that analysis. Both analyses also adjusted for self-reported physical activity and smoking status, among other covariates. With such small numbers of cases and  the potential for residual confounding,  the contradictory results of these two analyses suggest that there is scant evidence to conclude that nonsurgical weight loss is protective for endometrial cancer.</Para><Para id="_313">Bariatric surgery is associated with more sustained weight loss compared with nonsurgical intentional weight loss.<Reference refidx="15"/> Evidence suggests an association between bariatric surgery and a decreased risk of endometrial cancer.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/> In a prospective cohort study from Sweden, 1,420 women with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery and 1,447 matched controls who underwent conventional obesity treatment were followed for a median of 18.1 years.<Reference refidx="16"/> Mean weight loss after bariatric surgery was 21 kilograms at 10 years, compared with almost no change in weight in the usual care cohort. In this study, bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35–0.89). Of note, this was not a prespecified study end point or powered to evaluate incidence of cancer.  A retrospective cohort study through the Kaiser Permanente health system evaluated 22,198 individuals who had bariatric surgery and 66,427 nonsurgical individuals who were matched on sex, age, study site, BMI, and Elixhauser comorbidity index.<Reference refidx="17"/>  More than 80% of the cohort was female. After a mean follow-up time of 3.5 years, there was a 50% reduction in the incidence of endometrial cancer (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37–0.67) in the cohort who underwent bariatric surgery. A systematic review,  which included five observational studies with a control group, reported a decrease in the odds of developing endometrial cancer after bariatric surgery (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16–0.63).<Reference refidx="18"/> A large retrospective cohort study from England, which followed patients for a median of 3 years in the surgery group and 2.5 years in the no-surgery group, did not find an association with a decreased risk of endometrial cancer after bariatric surgery compared with the control group of patients with obesity.<Reference refidx="19"/> The association of bariatric surgery and decrease in the incidence of endometrial cancer may be caused by secondary effects of weight loss. In one study, women who underwent bariatric surgery had a 35% decrease in blood estradiol levels 1 year after surgery.<Reference refidx="20"/> Bariatric surgery has also been associated with a return to regular menstrual cycles in a high proportion of women with previous menstrual irregularities.<Reference refidx="21"/> The Surgical Procedures and Long-term Effectiveness in Neoplastic Disease Incidence and Death (SPLENDID) study was a retrospective, observational, matched cohort study of patients with obesity who underwent contemporary bariatric surgery (i.e., Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy) or received usual care (no bariatric surgery).<Reference refidx="22"/> Median follow-up was 6.1 years. The primary end point was the first occurrence of 1 of 13 predefined obesity-associated cancers. Secondary end points included incidence of all types of cancer and cancer-related mortality.<Reference refidx="22"/> In the adjusted Cox models that evaluated incidence of individual cancer types, only endometrial cancer remained significant (adjusted HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27–0.83).  There were limitations to this study, which included selection bias and different rates of cancer screening behaviors between the study arms, stemming from the observational nature of the study. In addition, there was the low number of incident cancers and a limited follow-up time.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_285"><Title>Physical Activity</Title><Para id="_286">A meta-analysis combined data from prospective studies of recreational activity (nine studies) and occupational activity (five studies) to determine whether activity is associated with endometrial cancer.<Reference refidx="23"/>  The highest category of recreational activity was associated with an RR of endometrial cancer of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58–0.93), compared with lowest category. The RR of endometrial cancer for the highest category of occupational physical activity, based on job classification, was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.68–0.83), compared with the lowest category.  Further investigation using the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) and combining data from case-control and cohort studies revealed a decrease in endometrial cancer risk with activity up to 50 MET-hours per week (up to 15 hours/week).<Reference refidx="24"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_287"><Title>Smoking</Title><Para id="_288">Ever-smokers who smoked at least 20 cigarettes per day have a decreased risk of endometrial cancer, with greatest risk reductions seen in postmenopausal women and in current smokers.  This effect has been seen in observational cohort, prospective cohort, and case-control studies and was summarized in a meta-analysis.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/> However, such a decrease does not begin to compensate for the many well-documented  harms of smoking. These harms  are most evident in the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and other cancers, to the extent that smokers have at least a 10-year decrease in overall life expectancy, compared with nonsmokers.<Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_366">In contrast, Mendelian randomization analyses have not shown a causal relationship between smoking and decreased endometrial cancer risk in the U.K. Biobank and European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) patient cohorts, questioning the strength of this association that was seen in the study's observational analyses.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="19924816">Dossus L, Allen N, Kaaks R, et al.: Reproductive risk factors and endometrial cancer: the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.
