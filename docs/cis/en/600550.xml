Of 65 genes previously reported to be associated with LCH, only 11 were found to be upregulated in the array results.  The most highly upregulated gene in both CD207-positive and CD3-positive cells was <GeneName>SPP1</GeneName> (encoding the osteopontin protein); other genes that activate and recruit T cells to sites of inflammation are also upregulated.<Reference refidx="1"/> The expression profile of the T cells was that of an activated regulatory T-cell phenotype with increased expression of <GeneName>FOXP3</GeneName>, <GeneName>CTLA4</GeneName>, and <GeneName>SPP1</GeneName>.

Only osteopontin proved to be significantly increased in the CSF of LCH patients with either neurodegeneration or mass lesions (pituitary), compared with all of the control groups.

Pulmonary LCH is the exception to this finding. Delays of many months or years commonly occur before adults are diagnosed, and they have long-term issues with chronic pain and fatigue. There are other differences from childhood LCH, including frequency of various bone sites of disease. It also appears that multisystem high-risk LCH in adults may be less aggressive than high-risk disease in children. A consensus group reported on the evaluation and treatment of adult patients with LCH.<Reference refidx="1"/> However, treatment discussions continue, particularly regarding optimal first-line therapy.</Para><Para id="_2479">A multicenter retrospective review of 219 adult patients (aged &gt;18 years) with LCH was conducted to assess long-term outcomes. The median follow-up was 74 months. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 58%, and the overall survival (OS) rate was 88%. About one-third of deaths were LCH-related and occurred within 5 years of diagnosis. Second cancers occurred in 16.4% of cases (both hematologic and solid tumors). Deaths that occurred 5 or more years after diagnosis were predominantly non-LCH related (i.e., second cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease). Compared with the general U.S. population, patients with LCH had a higher standard mortality ratio (SMR) if diagnosed before age 55 years (SMR, 5.94) or had multisystem disease (SMR, 4.12).<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><SummarySection id="_142"><Title>Incidence </Title><Para id="_2435">A population-based study in England found that the incidence of LCH in patients older than 15 years was 1.05 cases per 1 million people.<Reference refidx="3"/> Of these individuals, 44% were younger than 45 years.

LCH in adults is often similar to that in children and appears to involve the same organs, although the incidence in each organ may be different. There is a predominance of lung disease in adults, usually occurring as single-system disease and closely associated with smoking and some unique biological characteristics. Most isolated lung LCH cases in adults are  polyclonal and possibly reactive, while fewer lung LCH cases are monoclonal.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_1873">A German registry with 121 registrants showed that 62% had single-organ involvement and 38% had multisystem involvement. Pulmonary LCH occurred in 34% of the total study population. Lungs are the most common site, followed by bone and skin involvement. The median age at diagnosis was 44 years (±12.8 years).  All organ systems found in childhood LCH were seen in these adults, including endocrine and central nervous system (CNS), liver, spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. The major difference is the much higher incidence of isolated pulmonary LCH in adults, particularly in young adults who smoke. Other differences appear to be the more frequent involvement of genital and oral mucosa.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_2020">Presenting signs and symptoms from published studies include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_2021" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Dyspnea or tachypnea.</ListItem><ListItem>Polydipsia and polyuria.</ListItem><ListItem>Bone pain.</ListItem><ListItem>Soft tissue swelling near bone lesions.</ListItem><ListItem>Skin rash or scalp nodules.</ListItem><ListItem>Lymphadenopathy.</ListItem><ListItem>Weight loss.</ListItem><ListItem>Fever.</ListItem><ListItem>Gingival hypertrophy.</ListItem><ListItem>Ataxia.</ListItem><ListItem>Memory problems.</ListItem><ListItem>Hepatosplenomegaly.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_146">Patients who present with isolated diabetes insipidus should be carefully observed for the onset of other signs or symptoms characteristic of LCH.
