Sweating can be part of the hot flash complex that characterizes the vasomotor instability of menopause.

Limited data exist related to effective treatments that can target both symptoms. One pilot trial evaluated mirtazapine (a tetracyclic antidepressant that mainly affects serotonin) for hot flashes because it is often prescribed for sleep difficulties. Twenty-two women received mirtazapine titrated up to 30 mg per day at bedtime over a 3-week period; then they could choose 15 mg or 30 mg at bedtime daily for the fourth week. Hot flashes were reduced by approximately 53% in this nonrandomized trial, and women were statistically significantly satisfied with their hot flash control.<Reference refidx="44"/> However, only 16 of the 22 women stayed on the agent for the entire study period because of excessive grogginess.

In other words, for women who were using antidepressants exclusively to manage hot flashes that were inadequately controlled, initiation of gabapentin with discontinuation of the antidepressant produced results equal to those obtained with combined therapy, resulting in the need for fewer medications. Similarly, in a pilot study of women receiving inadequate benefit from venlafaxine for hot flash reduction, switching to open-label citalopram, 20 mg per day, resulted in a 50% reduction in hot flash frequency and score.<Reference refidx="48"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_224"><Title>Drug Interactions</Title><Para id="_225">Many SSRIs can inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of tamoxifen, which is commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer.

Wild-type CYP2D6 metabolizes tamoxifen to an active metabolite, 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyl-tamoxifen, also known as endoxifen. A prospective trial evaluating the effects on tamoxifen metabolism of the coadministration of tamoxifen and  paroxetine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, found that paroxetine coadministration resulted in decreased concentrations of endoxifen.
