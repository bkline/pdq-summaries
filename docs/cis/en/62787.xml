This is done by assigning a category of extent of disease for the tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M). T, N, and M are assigned by clinical means and by adding surgical findings and pathological information to the clinical information. The documented prognostic impact of postneoadjuvant extent of disease  and response to therapy warrant clear definitions of the use of the <Emphasis>yp</Emphasis> prefix and response to therapy. The use of neoadjuvant therapy does not change the clinical (pretreatment) stage. As per TNM rules, the anatomical component of clinical stage is identified with the prefix <Emphasis>c</Emphasis> (e.g., cT). In addition, clinical staging can include the use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core-needle biopsy and sentinel lymph node biopsy before neoadjuvant therapy. These are denoted with the postscripts <Emphasis>f </Emphasis>and <Emphasis>sn</Emphasis>, respectively. Nodal metastases confirmed by FNA or core-needle biopsy are classified as macrometastases (cN1), regardless of the size of the tumor focus in the final pathological specimen. For example, if, prior to neoadjuvant systemic therapy, a  patient with a 1 cm primary has no palpable nodes but has an ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of an axillary lymph node that is positive, the patient will be categorized as cN1 (f) for clinical (pretreatment) staging and is assigned to Stage IIA. Likewise, if the patient has a positive axillary sentinel node identified before neoadjuvant systemic therapy, the tumor is categorized as cN1 (sn) (Stage IIA). As per TNM rules, in the absence of pathological T evaluation (removal of the primary tumor), which is identified with prefix <Emphasis>p</Emphasis> (e.g., pT), microscopic evaluation of nodes before neoadjuvant therapy, even by complete removal such as sentinel node biopsy, is still classified as clinical (cN).</entry></Row></TFoot><TBody><Row><entry>TX</entry><entry>Primary tumor cannot be assessed.</entry></Row><Row><entry>T0</entry><entry>No evidence of primary tumor.</entry></Row><Row><entry>Tis<Superscript>b</Superscript> </entry><entry><Emphasis>DCIS</Emphasis>.</entry></Row><Row><entry>Tis (Paget)</entry><entry>Paget disease of the nipple NOT associated with invasive carcinoma and/or DCIS in the underlying breast parenchyma.

The RCB method provides a standard to evaluate and quantify the extent of residual disease in breast and axillary lymph nodes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  It is reported as a continuous score, with pCR being scored as RCB-0. There are four RCB classes ranging from RCB-0 to RCB-3.  Determining RCB after neoadjuvant treatment has been validated as a prognostic predictor in early breast cancer.  </Para><Para id="_2695">A pooled, multinational, multi-institutional analysis was performed, using participant-level RCB results and clinicopathological data.  Data from 5,161 patients were analyzed to assess the association between the continuous RCB score and the primary study outcome, EFS.

RCB score was prognostic for EFS in multivariable models adjusted for age, grade, T (tumor) category, and nodal status at baseline.

The SOUND trial randomly assigned 1,493 women with invasive breast cancer to undergo SLN biopsy or no axillary surgery. Patients were of any age, had tumors smaller than 2 cm, had negative preoperative axillary ultrasonography, and planned to receive breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy (cited Gentilini et al. as reference 34 and level of evidence A1). The INSEMA trial randomly assigned 5,502 women with clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer to undergo no axillary surgery or SLN biopsy. Tumors had to be smaller than 5 cm, and most patients had T1 disease and estrogen receptor–positive tumors. Patients were scheduled to undergo breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast radiation therapy (cited Reimer et al. as reference 35 and level of evidence A1).</Para><Para id="_3644"><Strong><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062787#_2687" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-treatment-pdq">Systemic Therapy for Stages I, II, and III Breast Cancer</SummaryRef></Strong></Para><Para id="_3645">Added <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062787#_3435" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-treatment-pdq">text</SummaryRef> about an open-label trial in Japan that included 1,697 patients who had received either (1) 5 years of anastrozole or (2) 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen, followed by 2 to 3 years of anastrozole.
