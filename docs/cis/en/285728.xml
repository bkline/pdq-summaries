The actual duration of Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment for these patients ranged from more than 17 months to more than 24 months.

Among the 13 patients in the control group, nine had weight measurements made at study entry and at an average of 2.6 months later (range, 1–7 months); however, the second body-weight measurements were not available for four control subjects. The average percent body-weight loss for the six patients in the Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment group was 2.1%; for the nine patients in the control group, the average percent body-weight loss was 11.6%.

For the 13 patients in the control group, KPS was measured at study entry and 1 to 3 months later. The first and second KPS scores did not differ substantially for the patients in the Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment group. In fact, the second score was higher (indicating an improving condition) for five of the six patients; for the sixth patient, the first and second scores were the same.  The second KPS score was lower than the first (indicating a worsening condition) for all 13 patients in the control group. When the average KPS score at study entry for the control subjects was compared with the average score measured 1 to 3 months later, a statistically significant decline in KPS was noted.

Several major weaknesses in the design and execution of the trial could have affected the outcome. One major weakness is the small numbers of patients enrolled in the survival arm (six patients in the Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment group and 13 in the control group). Larger numbers of patients are needed to obtain reliable results.  Another weakness is that the patients in the survival arm were not <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322881" dictionary="Cancer.gov" audience="Patient">randomly</GlossaryTermRef> assigned to the treatment group and the control group. The treatment group consisted of  individuals who agreed to be treated with Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup; those who refused treatment were assigned to  the control group. It is possible that important, unidentified differences existed between patients in the two groups.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_48">In 2001, the developer reported clinical findings for an additional 16 patients who had stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and who had been treated with Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup.<Reference refidx="2"/> The formulation ingested by these patients was Frozen SV, or FSV.<Reference refidx="2"/> Among the 16 patients, 12 consumed FSV for a period of 2 months or more and were considered eligible for analysis.
