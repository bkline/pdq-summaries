This summary describes the experiences of informal caregivers of people with cancer, explains the risk factors for caregiver burden (which is often associated with negative psychological consequences), and evaluates evidence-based interventions designed to reduce the burden of informal caregiving. The goal of the summary is to provide the oncology clinician with both a deeper appreciation of the importance of informal caregivers, and the information necessary to recognize burdened caregivers and effectively intervene.</Para><SummarySection id="_14"><Title>Who Are Informal Caregivers and What Roles Do They Play?</Title><Para id="_149">In 2016, the National Alliance for Caregiving reported an analysis of the survey responses of 111 caregivers who self-identified as providing care to a person with cancer.<Reference refidx="3"/> The respondents were part of a much larger study that identified a representative sample of adult caregivers who provided unpaid care to an adult relative or friend in the 12 months preceding the time of the survey.</Para><Para id="_150">The following findings provide a snapshot of informal caregivers of people with cancer and the challenges they face:</Para><ItemizedList id="_18" Style="bullet">

One study demonstrated that caregivers correctly reported 67% of patients’ physical difficulties, 69% of patients’ psychological difficulties, and 40% of patients’ social difficulties.<Reference refidx="9"/> There were no predictive demographic factors. In further support of the need for caution, an analysis of office visits recorded on audiotape revealed that caregivers often spoke on behalf of patients without validation by the patients.<Reference refidx="10"/> In addition to this pseudo-surrogacy, caregivers often conflated their concerns with those of the patients.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_155"><Title>The Psychological Consequences of Caregiving</Title><Para id="_156">The psychological consequences of caregiving vary widely. Some caregivers report positive outcomes such as post-traumatic growth and benefit finding.

     <ListItem>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies representing 11,396 caregivers of people with cancer, the pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms was 42.08% (95% confidence interval, 34.71%–49.45%). Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they used validated instruments to assess depression. However, the authors did not differentiate between studies that used cutoff scores associated with mild depressive symptoms and clinically significant depression.<Reference refidx="17"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</ListItem><ListItem>A telephone survey of 196 caregivers of patients with renal cell carcinoma studied the associations between psychological adjustment and caregivers’ experiences and unmet needs. Investigators demonstrated that 64% of caregivers had at least one significant unmet need, 53% had three or more unmet needs, and 29% had ten or more unmet needs.<Reference refidx="18"/> Investigators found elevated anxiety in 29% of respondents and depression in 11%. Unmet information needs and worse  experiences of care during surgery were risk factors for caregiver depression. Unmet information needs were the only risk factor for anxiety.</ListItem><ListItem>A cross-sectional analysis assessed baseline data on caregivers of patients with advanced-stage lung or colorectal cancers enrolled in a randomized trial of early palliative care.<Reference refidx="19"/> A significant proportion of caregivers reported elevated levels of anxiety (42.2%) or depression (21.5%). Risk factors for caregiver depression were patients’ expectation of cure and patients’ use of emotional support coping. Patients’ use of acceptance coping was associated with less caregiver anxiety. A study of caregivers of patients with pancreatic cancer reported similar results: 39% of caregivers had elevated levels of anxiety, and 14% had elevated levels of depression, compared with  community norms.<Reference refidx="20"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_178"><Strong>PTSD: </Strong>One of the negative consequences of caregiving that persists is PTSD. A preliminary study of caregivers of patients with head and neck cancer 6 months after diagnosis demonstrated that approximately 20% met the criteria for PTSD.<Reference refidx="21"/> Risk factors for PTSD included the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_179" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Caregiver perception of low treatment benefit.</ListItem><ListItem>Caregiver perception of many patient symptoms.</ListItem><ListItem>Caregiver use of avoidant coping strategies.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_180">The same investigators also showed in a similar population that differences in illness perceptions were dynamic over 6 months, but greater differences were correlated with reduced health-related quality of life (QOL) in patients.<Reference refidx="22"/></Para><Para id="_181"><Strong>Decline in caregiver QOL: </Strong>Several investigators have published measures of caregiver QOL while patients were undergoing active treatment. One study demonstrated that caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant experience a decline in their QOL, as measured by the physical and mental component of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_248">Patients receiving palliative therapy also rely heavily on informal caregivers. In a study of 201 informal caregivers of patients undergoing palliative radiation therapy for advanced cancer, additional employment of the caregiver, cohabitation, poor patient performance status, and interest in accessing  more support services were significantly correlated with higher caregiver burden (poorer QOL).<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_171">In summary, a caregiver provides essential support and resources to the person with cancer. However, the role of informal caregiver creates demands that may exceed the caregiver’s resources and, ultimately, cause negative psychological consequences. The rest of this summary focuses on the significant minority of caregivers who experience unmet needs and increased physical and psychological distress. After a brief review of the concept of caregiver burden, information about the demands on caregivers, resources valued by caregivers, potential moderators of caregiver burden, and coping strategies will be presented.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Caregiving in the U.S. 2020.

The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping is a useful framework for describing the relationships among caregiver demands, resources, burden, and the psychological consequences of being burdened.<Reference refidx="1"/>  From this perspective, a burden is perceived when the demands on the caregiver exceed the resources available. See the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000681705#_242" url="/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-hp-pdq">figure</SummaryRef> below for an illustration of how this framework may be applied to caregiver burden.</Para><Para id="_243">The process begins with the primary appraisal, which is a judgment about the relevance of the health threat and any demands on the caregiver.  A demand that is judged to be relevant receives a secondary appraisal to evaluate the likelihood that available resources have the potential to reduce or overcome the demand.  Burden is perceived to be high when the difficulty of the demand outweighs the available resources. Coping strategies may also determine whether the psychological consequences of the perceived burden are negative or positive.</Para><MediaLink ref="CDR0000799645" type="image/jpeg" alt="Chart showing the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, including the primary appraisal of health threats (illness that endangers personal goals and values) and antecedents (age, gender, health status, and employment); secondary appraisal of caregiver demands (daily living tasks, information, transportation, and decision making) and resources (social support, health team, interventions, and palliative care consults); coping (when resources are greater than demands and when demands are greater than resources) and coping strategies (problem focused, emotion focused, and meaning focused); and caregiver outcomes (acceptable burden and negative and positive psychological consequences of being burdened)." language="en" placement="image-center" id="_242"><Caption language="en">The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping may explain why some caregivers experience burden and negative psychological consequences.

In addition, older caregivers of cancer patients may neglect their own health needs, have less time to exercise, forget to take their own prescription medications, and become fatigued from interrupted sleep.

In a meta-analysis of 116 empirical studies, Asian American caregivers provided more caregiving hours than White, African American, and Hispanic caregivers; used lower levels of formal support services; and had fewer financial resources, lower levels of education, and higher levels of depression than other groups.<Reference refidx="22"/> These findings are important for the oncology team because caregivers with no outside help are more depressed than are  those who receive help.</Para><Para id="_209">A study involving unmet needs and service barriers among Asian American caregivers found that caregivers refused outside help because they “felt too proud to accept it” or “didn’t want outsiders coming in.” Other barriers included “bureaucracy too complex” or “can’t find qualified providers.”<Reference refidx="23"/>  A study of hospice use by Asian American patients found that family  reluctance to discuss a patient's health status among themselves resulted in lower rates of hospice enrollment. This reluctance was rooted in the belief that talking about death or dying is bad luck, which could complicate discussions about prognosis and informed consent.<Reference refidx="24"/> Keeping a cancer diagnosis secret from a patient and avoiding discussions about disease progression can add to a caregiver’s sense of burden and responsibility.</Para><Para id="_210">Similarly, Hispanic and African American patients and caregivers underutilize community health resources, including counseling and support groups, home care, residential care, and hospice services. Strong family ties may prevent these caregivers from seeking help outside of the family unit.<Reference refidx="25"/> A study that compared African American, White, and Hispanic caregivers found that 75% of Hispanic patients and 60% of African American patients lived with the family of the primary caregiver. The racial and ethnic minority families relied more on informal caregiving from friends and relatives and had larger social support networks than the White families. However, this increased sense of obligation to care for older family members was associated with more caregiving hours, greater resignation about caregiving, higher levels of caregiver strain, and a larger reduction in household income compared with White caregivers.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/> For more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000814680#_437" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/hospice-hp-pdq">Disparities in Hospice Utilization</SummaryRef> section in Hospice.</Para><Para id="_211">Another study analyzed reports of employment loss due to caregiving responsibilities.

One possible explanation for these findings is that while patients’ physical and practical needs may decrease after treatment, caregivers may experience heightened uncertainty and fear of cancer recurrence during survivorship.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_48"><Title>Survivorship</Title><Para id="_49">The evidence demonstrates that although the prevalence of unmet needs diminishes over time, many caregivers continue to experience needs related to the cancer experience during the survivorship phase.</Para><Para id="_50">For example, a longitudinal study was designed to track the psychosocial, financial, and occupational impact of having ongoing needs as a caregiver in Australia.<Reference refidx="8"/> The investigators analyzed responses to the Supportive Care Needs Survey—Partners and Caregivers (SCNS–P&amp;C) from 547 caregivers at 6 months, 519 caregivers at 12 months, and 443  caregivers at 24 months after the cancer diagnosis. Of note, 444  of the original 547 participants completed surveys at 12 months, and 372 completed surveys at 24 months.</Para><Para id="_51">Several findings deserve emphasis:</Para><ItemizedList id="_52" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>The proportion of caregivers reporting any unmet need decreased from 50.2% at 6 months to 30.7% at 24 months.</ListItem><ListItem>A similar decline was seen for caregivers who reported at least five or ten unmet needs, although the baseline prevalence was lower.</ListItem><ListItem>The most pressing unmet needs were related to concerns about cancer recurrence, reducing stress in the survivor’s life, and understanding the survivor’s experience.</ListItem><ListItem>Unmet needs were negatively associated  with caregivers’ well-being (although not uniformly).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_258">In a longitudinal study of 120 dyads of patients with hepatobiliary or pancreatic cancer and their caregivers, at diagnosis 25% of caregivers reported high levels of chronic depressive symptoms, and 21% had high levels of stress.<Reference refidx="9"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Levels of depressive symptoms and stress at diagnosis remained high up to 18 months postdiagnosis, while those with low to moderate levels of depressive symptoms and stress at diagnosis saw those levels decline over time. Patient depressive symptoms also predicted caregiver stress. These findings suggest that  caregivers with higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress at diagnosis may be the most vulnerable over time, but further research is needed in more diverse samples, as most caregivers were women (85%). Similarly, a 2021 study found that in 111 caregivers of newly diagnosed cancer patients, poorer caregiver QOL was associated  with higher levels of caregiver depression, anxiety, and stress, and that caregiver QOL and levels of social support changed over the treatment trajectory.<Reference refidx="10"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_53"><Title>End of Life</Title><Para id="_54">The end-of-life experiences of patients with advanced cancer influence the burden on caregivers and their eventual psychological adjustment during bereavement. A longitudinal study of caregivers of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer provides valuable insights into the caregiver’s experience in the last year of the patient’s life.<Reference refidx="11"/> Ninety-nine caregivers completed measures every 3 months for 2 years. The caregivers reported lower-than-expected mental and physical QOL. The average distress level and number of unmet needs increased over time. Perceived social support did not change. Caregiver distress was predicted by lower optimism, higher unmet needs, and shortened time to patient death. Patient QOL was not a predictor. In the last 6 months of the patient’s life, managing emotions about poor prognosis and balancing work with caregiving demands were related to high unmet needs among caregivers.</Para><Para id="_252">One potential source of caregiver distress toward the end of life is the ambiguity around caregivers' role in decisions to limit potentially life-sustaining treatments such as chemotherapy or resuscitation. Two studies provide clarifying observations.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/> One study embedded researchers during hospitalizations of patients with advanced cancer to record the participation of caregivers in decisions to limit treatment.<Reference refidx="12"/> The investigators identified 70 patients, but only 63 had caregivers present. In the cohort, only 32% of relatives were involved, both positively and negatively. Clinicians were more often aware of patients’ preferences when relatives were present (78% vs. 29%, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .014). However, caregivers did not always agree with patients and, in one-third of the observations, contradicted the patients. Thus, caregivers may be a source of insight but do not necessarily accurately reflect patients’ wishes.</Para><Para id="_253">The caregiver’s importance to the decision-making process may vary based on clinicians’ attitudes. In an interview study of oncology physicians and nurses, two broad perspectives were found: maintaining patient autonomy independent of caregiver influence and facilitating decision-making by actively involving caregivers seeking consensus.<Reference refidx="13"/> These perspectives were based on a desire to enhance the positive aspects of caregivers’ support (e.g., emotional, encouragement to plan, and understanding of information) while minimizing the potential barriers (e.g., family reluctance to accept the patient is at the end of life, the need to mediate conflicts, and the increased time required to include caregivers). These findings highlight the potential value of caregivers and the need to develop specific strategies for including them in end-of-life discussions.</Para><Para id="_55">Hospice care can provide critical support to caregivers as well as patients. One group of investigators compared the burden and QOL of caregivers of patients with advanced cancer who were receiving active treatment with the burden and QOL of caregivers of patients who were receiving hospice care.<Reference refidx="14"/> The goal was to characterize the demands unique to the hospice phase of care. The investigators found no difference in the perceived burden of caregiving and increased role limitations due to mental or emotional challenges. However, caregivers in the hospice group reported fewer physical limitations. Similarly, another group reported that longer hospice stays were associated with better patient QOL and better caregiver adjustment during bereavement.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_241">A potential explanation for the benefit of hospice is that caregivers are reassured by  the higher quality of end-of-life care and the honoring of  patients’ goals. One study analyzed  interviews with 1,146 family members of Medicare beneficiaries who died of advanced-stage lung or colorectal cancer.<Reference refidx="16"/> The results demonstrated that hospice enrollment was associated with more “excellent” ratings for quality of care reported by family members. Similarly, patients who received intensive care or had short hospice enrollments were less frequently reported to have died in their preferred place.<Reference refidx="17"/> For more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000814680" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/hospice-hp-pdq">Hospice</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_57">Caregivers may also require support to effectively participate in decisions about whether to provide patients with artificial nutrition or hydration (ANH). Investigators conducted a prospective cross-sectional survey of 39 patients with advanced cancer and 30 relatives about their views on ANH.<Reference refidx="18"/> Only 24% of relatives stated they would opt out of ANH if deciding on behalf of their loved ones, and 48% were against hydration. Patients were less concerned than their relatives about adverse physical symptoms such as pain, agitation, and hunger. Patients endorsed their family members’ opinions as important in these decisions.

These parents report shock, emotional pain, difficulty coping with the necessary procedures performed on their child, rumination, and high levels of information seeking accompanied by a sense of lack of control.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> One study evaluated 119 mothers and 52 fathers of children undergoing cancer treatment. The study found that all but one participant  reported traumatic stress symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, physiological arousal, and avoidance.<Reference refidx="4"/> In another study, parents of children undergoing treatment (n = 175) were compared with parents of children who had completed treatment (n = 238). Parents reported symptoms of traumatic stress (such as intrusion and arousal) more frequently during the acute phase of treatment than after treatment. Certain demographic factors may play a role in the degree to which parents experience significant stress that impairs function. Mothers were more likely than fathers to report higher levels of stress, and parents with fewer years of formal education and lower socioeconomic status were more likely to experience traumatic stress at any time.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_277">Patterns of parental stress in families of children treated for cancer differ from those in families of children treated for other diseases. In one large study of 675 parents, parents of children with cancer reported significantly higher levels of distress—as indicated by anxiety, physical and psychological distress, depression, and loneliness—than did parents of children with diabetes.
