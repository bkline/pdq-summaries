Early identification and treatment of these tumors may decrease morbidity significantly. ELST screening typically includes clinical assessment, audiogram, and imaging. The VHL Alliance's  expert consensus guideline on screening recommendations for ELSTs is based on available evidence.<Reference refidx="3"/> Since ELSTs in VHL have an average onset of age 30 years (range, 6–62 y), suggested screening begins at age 11 years. A thorough clinical history can identify patients with common audiovestibular symptoms including tinnitus, vertigo, aural fullness, and hearing loss. Annual clinical assessment is also recommended starting at age 11 years, with additional workup if new symptoms are reported.<Reference refidx="11"/> Diagnostic audiograms can identify hearing loss across various frequencies.  Audiograms are recommended every 2 years beginning at age 11 years. However, the specificity for ELST identification is low, since hearing loss is common in the general population. Notably though, hearing loss often occurs at younger ages in patients with VHL who have ELSTs.<Reference refidx="12"/>  While rare, the identification of ELSTs prior to imaging have been reported.<Reference refidx="11"/> If clinical symptoms of ELSTs occur or the patient has an abnormal audiogram, further assessment via imaging is recommended. MRI is the mainstay test to identify small ELSTs. While an MRI of the brain is useful, a thin-cut   MRI scan of the inner auditory canal (IAC) can identify lesions as small as 2 mm in size and has high diagnostic specificity.<Reference refidx="13"/> Intralabyrinthine hemorrhage, hydrops, and soft tissue enhancement are typical findings associated with ELSTs. A baseline MRI of the IAC is suggested between ages 15 to 20 years to assess anatomy.<Reference refidx="11"/> Particular attention to the inner ear is recommended on routine brain imaging as part of hemangioblastoma assessments. A thin-slice CT of the temporal bone is another useful modality for ELST confirmation. While this screening modality can aid in preoperative planning, it  does have the inherent risks of radiation. Screening for ELSTs beyond age 65 years has questionable benefit, since there have been no reports of patients with ELSTs beyond age 62 years.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="35579632">Wolters WPG, Dreijerink KMA, Giles RH, et al.: Multidisciplinary integrated care pathway for von Hippel-Lindau disease.

Some initial surgical series performed bilateral radical nephrectomies for renal tumors followed by  renal transplant.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>

While rare, some patients with VHL undergo repeated kidney surgeries, which eventually make them dependent on renal replacement therapy. Renal transplants appear safe in patients with VHL, with adequate graft survival outcomes.<Reference refidx="3"/> However, preserving the kidneys has become a priority during these procedures. Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) was introduced in the 1980s for VHL after several groups demonstrated that this method conferred a low risk of cancer spread using a less radical surgical approach.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>
In 1995, a large multi-institutional series demonstrated how NSS could produce excellent cancer-specific survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).<Reference refidx="6"/>
 Because of multiple reports of excellent outcomes, NSS is now considered the surgical standard of care for VHL-associated RCCs when technically feasible. Over time, NSS techniques have been refined for patients with VHL  to minimize damage to the adjacent normal parenchyma. For example, in traditional NSS, a wide margin of tissue is taken. However, in a subsequent type of NSS called enucleation, much of the adjacent normal parenchyma can be preserved.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_3223">Patients with VHL can have dozens of renal tumors. Therefore, resection of all evident renal disease may not be feasible. To minimize the morbidity of multiple surgical procedures, loss of kidney function, and the risk of distant progression, a method  to balance overtreatment and undertreatment was sought. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) evaluated a specific tumor-size threshold to trigger surgical intervention. An evaluation of 52 patients with VHL or hereditary papillary renal carcinoma who were treated when their largest solid renal lesion reached 3 cm demonstrated no evidence of distant metastases or the need for renal replacement therapy after a median follow-up period of 60 months.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Subsequent retrospective series reinforced the importance of this 3-cm tumor-size threshold. For example, in one study, none of the 108 patients with VHL showed evidence of distant metastases when renal tumors were managed at sizes of 3 cm or smaller.<Reference refidx="9"/> In patients with tumors larger than 3 cm, 27.3% (20 of 73) developed distant recurrences.<Reference refidx="9"/>
 This 3-cm tumor-size threshold is now widely used in the United States to trigger surgical intervention for VHL-associated clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). However, some international research groups have published data that support active surveillance of renal tumors until they reach 4 cm.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/> When surgery is performed on a patient with VHL, resection of as many renal tumors as is clinically feasible may delay the need for further surgical interventions.<Reference refidx="14"/>
The use of intraoperative ultrasound is helpful to identify and remove smaller lesions.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_3224">Many patients with VHL develop new RCCs on an ongoing basis and may  require further intervention. Adhesions and perinephric scarring make subsequent surgical procedures more challenging. While a radical nephrectomy could be considered, NSS remains the preferred approach, when feasible. While there may be a higher incidence of complications, repeat and salvage NSS can enable patients to maintain excellent renal function and provide promising oncological outcomes at the time of intermediate follow-up.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>

Cryoablation (CA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were introduced in the late 1990s to manage small renal masses.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>
For <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339347" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">sporadic</GlossaryTermRef> renal masses, both thermal ablative techniques achieved a recurrence-free survival rate of nearly 90%, leading the American Urologic Association to recommend discussing this technique with  high-risk patients who have small renal masses (≤4 cm).<Reference refidx="21"/> For patients with VHL, the clinical applications of ablative techniques are still not clearly defined, and surgery remains the most-studied intervention. Ablative techniques were introduced to VHL-associated RCC management in a phase II trial investigating the effects of ablation at the time of lesion resection. In this study, 11 tumors were treated, and an intra-operative ultrasound showed complete elimination of blood flow to the tumors. On final pathology, there was evidence of treatment effect on all tumors.<Reference refidx="22"/>
Since that time, some centers have successfully used thermal ablative techniques for primary and salvage management in patients with VHL.<Reference refidx="23"/> Other centers have found that techniques such as RFA have a high failure rate and should be reserved for patients with marginal renal function.<Reference refidx="24"/> Despite limited long-term data, these techniques have been increasingly  used to treat RCC in patients with VHL.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/> A single-institution study evaluated treatment trends in RCC in 113 patients with VHL.

Since partial adrenalectomy is the best surgical option for smaller PHEOs, the size and anatomical location of PHEOs should be considered when electing surveillance. Special considerations may be needed for patients undergoing future surgeries or childbirth.

Since PHEOs are multifocal and bilateral in individuals with VHL nearly  50% of the time,  many patients have undergone bilateral adrenalectomy and have required lifelong steroid replacement.<Reference refidx="35"/> The morbidity associated with adrenal replacement and the development of Cushing syndrome in individuals with VHL heightened interest in cortical-sparing partial adrenalectomy.  Even after extensive adrenal mobilization and tumor resection, the adrenal gland has extensive collateral arterial supply and venous drainage that can permit organ survival.<Reference refidx="36"/> Leaving at least 15% to 30% of residual adrenal gland volume is necessary to allow sufficient hormone production.<Reference refidx="37"/> Most adrenal glands will maintain functional cortisol production after cortical-sparing partial adrenalectomy is performed with modern techniques.

However, in the VHL population, the malignancy rate of PHEOs is low (&lt;5%).<Reference refidx="39"/> The local recurrence rate of PHEOs after partial adrenalectomy also appears to be low (0%–33%).  Therefore, when feasible and safe from an oncological perspective, most guidelines recommend partial adrenalectomy for managing PHEOs in patients with VHL.</Para><Para id="_3238">In a total adrenalectomy, the adrenal vein is usually divided early to limit catecholamine release during gland mobilization. However, in a partial adrenalectomy, dividing the adrenal vein can lead to venous congestion and gland compromise.<Reference refidx="40"/> In a patient with an effective preoperative catecholamine block, it may be possible to only clamp the adrenal vein during the resection and unclamp it after tumor excision. The optimal amount of adjacent normal parenchyma to remove is unclear. Initial surgical approaches for partial adrenalectomy in patients with tumors in the tail/head of the adrenal gland included removing this portion of the gland. However, when patients had tumors in the body of the adrenal gland, this region was resected along with a thin rim of normal parenchyma. As data have clarified the risk of malignancy and local recurrence of PHEOs in patients with VHL, a technique involving an enucleating resection of the tumor pseudocapsule has been described (which is similar to renal tumor enucleation  techniques). This approach may preserve the maximum amount of cortical tissue and limit vascular compromise to the residual adrenal gland.<Reference refidx="35"/> However, concerns over a higher rate of local recurrence may limit use of this approach.</Para><Para id="_3239"> Both open resection and laparoscopic surgical approaches are safe, but if feasible, laparoscopic removal of adrenal tissue is preferred.<Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="42"/> Means of exposure and approach are based on the anatomical location of the tumor. Direct access to the adrenal gland and para-aortic region can be achieved with the posterior approach, which is direct, safe, and efficient.<Reference refidx="43"/> Adequate exposure of the complete tumor is important for total removal. Robotic assistance can be used in select cases because it offers a three-dimensional, magnified view of the tumor's anatomy.<Reference refidx="44"/> When an individual has a history of  multiple abdominal procedures, a minimally invasive approach is  often not feasible because of adhesions. Open resection is commonly recommended for patients with large adrenal tumors because laparoscopy is difficult to perform within a confined space and increases risk of complications.

Pancreatic cysts in VHL do not show  enhancement on imaging and do not have malignant potential, regardless of size. Diffuse cystic disease of the pancreas rarely affects endocrine function.  Infrequently, cystic replacement of the normal pancreas can lead to a loss of exocrine function. When bloating, cramping, diarrhea, or abdominal pain occurs with fatty meals, enzymatic studies on the stool could be employed to determine if exocrine supplementation is indicated. Solid or mixed pancreatic lesions require specialized evaluation and treatment because they may be cystadenomas or pancreatic NETs. Most pancreatic NETs are nonfunctional, but laboratory evaluation with biochemical markers, such as chromogranin A, could be considered during the workup or follow-up. Imaging evaluation with a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both excellent modalities to characterize pancreatic lesions. Gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE positron emission tomography (PET)/CT has also been used to detect VHL-associated tumors.<Reference refidx="48"/> The performance metrics may depend on the lesion size and optimization of contrast administration timing.

The duration and modality for pancreatic imaging is center-dependent, but general principles include performing imaging every 1 to 2 years with the same examination method to allow meaningful comparisons. Pancreatic lesions with slow doubling times, sizes less than 3 cm, and a lack of exon 3 pathogenic variants have the most favorable outcomes.<Reference refidx="50"/> In a review of 175 VHL patients with pancreatic NETs, patients with tumors less than 1.2 cm in diameter  did not develop metastases or need surgeries.<Reference refidx="51"/> Patients with larger tumors (1.2–3.0 cm in diameter) and a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000783964" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">missense variant</GlossaryTermRef> in <GeneName>VHL</GeneName>, as opposed to other variant types, were more likely to develop metastases or require surgical invention.

A review of the natural history of pancreatic NETs shows that these tumors may demonstrate nonlinear growth characteristics.<Reference refidx="52"/> Pancreatic NETs are typically resected if they are 3 cm or larger (or ≥2 cm if the tumor is located in the head of the pancreas).<Reference refidx="53"/> Tumor enucleation is safe and effective if the lesion is not located near the pancreatic duct. If it is not safe to enucleate a lesion, a distal pancreatectomy is performed. Tumors in the head of the pancreas that are 2 cm or larger are also evaluated for resection, since larger lesions in this location are more challenging to enucleate. If the lesion is located too close to the pancreatic duct, a Whipple procedure is offered. For rare situations involving large multifocal lesions, a total pancreatectomy could be considered. After surgery, if patients develop exocrine dysfunction, enzyme supplementation may improve gastrointestinal symptoms and nutritional status.</Para><Para id="_3248">Positive lymph nodes should be removed if they are found during surgery.

While surgical resection of tumors is generally performed before the onset of neurological symptoms,<Reference refidx="68"/> this varies by center and may be influenced by factors like edema, tumor location, hydrocephalus, and the tumor's growth rate.  Spinal lesions are often approached posteriorly and require a laminectomy. Because patients often require multiple operations during their lifetimes, removal of support can lead to progressive spinal instability requiring stabilization/fusion.<Reference refidx="69"/> For cerebellar lesions, the surgical approach depends on the lateral orientation of the tumor, but many can be approached through a midline suboccipital incision.

Because audiovestibular compromise is not dependent on tumor size and can occur with small tumors, early intervention is generally preferred. Early intervention may also minimize the risk of invasion into surrounding structures and increase the probability of complete resection. A meta-analysis assessed outcomes from 82 studies that treated 252 tumors.<Reference refidx="74"/> A limited number of patients were observed,  and nearly all of them showed clinical progression, which argues  against this approach. Surgery has been the main treatment for ELSTs, with complete resection the optimal choice to avoid recurrence. Preoperative embolization has been performed to reduce the risk of perioperative morbidity and hemorrhage. The surgical approach often depends on a surgeon's preference, tumor location, and the patient's baseline hearing status. Complete resection of all disease is not always feasible due to tumor extension and invasion into surrounding structures. Thus, recurrence rates for ELSTs after surgery are high (16%). While radiation is not usually a primary treatment option, it is often performed as adjuvant treatment. Data are limited on systemic therapy approaches for ELSTs.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_3273"><Title>VHL-Specific Systemic Therapy for Localized Disease</Title><Para id="_3274">Patients with VHL often require multiple local treatments for their disease manifestations.

Understanding the biology of VHL has led to the development of targeted therapies that interfere with the downstream signaling cascade associated with tumorigenesis.<Reference refidx="75"/> Effective agents that target the VHL–hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway were developed to treat patients with advanced, sporadic ccRCCs. Afterward, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000803523" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">clinical utility</GlossaryTermRef> of these agents was investigated in individuals with VHL who had various VHL-related manifestations.</Para><Para id="_3275"> Initial research on tanespimycin (17-AAG) therapy highlighted that some patients may not prefer intravenous administration of medication. The modest toxicity and poor tolerability associated with 17-AAG  may deter healthy patients (with other surgical options) from using this treatment.<Reference refidx="76"/> Subsequently, a variety of agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway have been evaluated. Most of these agents demonstrated activity against renal tumors but only modest or absent activity against CNS hemangioblastomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and other VHL-related manifestations. A first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, was given to patients with VHL for up to four cycles (4 weeks on, then 2 weeks off). This drug was first explored in a cohort of 15 participants with various VHL-associated manifestations, all of whom did not need  immediate  medical intervention.<Reference refidx="77"/> While tumors did not enlarge  in these individuals (&gt;90% of participants), toxicity (including fatigue) led to frequent sunitinib dose reductions in 10 of 15 participants. The overall response rate (ORR) was 33% (6 of 18 tumors) in localized renal tumors, demonstrating the potential for  sunitinib therapy to influence the need for local intervention. Unfortunately, responses (as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) were not observed in CNS hemangioblastomas. In a retrospective review of 14 patients who had received sunitinib, responses were not seen in 11 patients with cerebellar hemangioblastomas and 8 patients with spinal hemangioblastomas.<Reference refidx="78"/> <ExternalRef xref="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/jco.2013.31.15_suppl.4584">Vandetanib</ExternalRef>, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a broad target specificity (including  vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR] and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), was evaluated in a phase II study of 37 patients. In this study, vandetanib was associated with limited activity and  toxicity, which required  frequent treatment interruptions and dose reductions.<Reference refidx="79"/> Pazopanib, a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a better toxicity profile than sunitinib,  was similarly studied in patients with VHL.<Reference refidx="80"/>  A cohort of 31 patients was treated with pazopanib for 24 weeks with an option to continue this therapy. Responses (as defined by RECIST) were observed in 52% of renal tumors and 53% of pancreatic lesions. Both malignant pancreatic NETs and benign pancreatic serous cystadenomas were included in this study. However, there was little activity against CNS hemangioblastomas with an ORR of 4%.  Pazopanib was also poorly tolerated, with only 23% of participants choosing to continue treatment beyond the initial 24-week period.</Para><Para id="_3276">While anti-VEGF therapy is administered systemically for most VHL-associated neoplasms, in VHL-associated  retinal tumors, it can be delivered  directly into the eye. Intravitreally-administered pegaptanib (an anti-VEGF therapy) was evaluated in five patients with VHL-associated retinal hemangioblastomas.<Reference refidx="81"/> Only two patients were able to complete the pegaptanib therapy, and responses were not seen in the patients' primary tumors. Two patients had decreased retinal thickening and a reduced number of hard exudates. Although  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved pegaptanib to treat macular degeneration, it is not approved for the treatment of VHL-associated retinal lesions.</Para><Para id="_3277">Research targeting downstream consequences of HIF upregulation (due to   inactivation of the <GeneName>VHL</GeneName>  gene) have had only modest success. Hence,  recent efforts have focused on targeting direct consequences of VHL loss. Multiple studies have demonstrated that multiple HIF molecules differentially regulate tumorigenesis, with HIF2 being the most critical mediator.<Reference refidx="82"/> This transcription factor became a promising target for treatment, but this only became possible when a new class of agents was developed that can selectively inhibit HIF2-alpha. These agents were designed to fit in the binding pocket of HIF2-alpha's Per-ARNT-SIM (PAS)-B domain. This  prevented HIF1-beta/ARNT dimerization and showed activity in laboratory models.<Reference refidx="83"/> This finding ultimately led to the development of belzutifan, an oral agent that was studied in an international phase II study of 61 participants with VHL-associated RCC across 11 centers.<Reference refidx="84"/> Unlike agents targeting the VEGF pathway, belzutifan was well-tolerated in participants and had a low rate of high-grade toxicity. The most common grade 3 adverse event was anemia (8% of patients), and  most patients remained on belzutifan after this paper was published (median follow-up period, 21.8 mo). Responses were observed in 49% of renal tumors, 77% of pancreatic tumors, and 30% of CNS tumors. All retinal tumors (16/16) improved after  belzutifan treatment. The FDA approved belzutifan for VHL-associated renal, pancreatic, and CNS hemangioblastomas that do not require immediate surgical intervention, based on activity and tolerability measurements from the trial. Additional research is expected to reveal the long-term efficacy and toxicity of this agent. Belzutifan is now used as an adjunct to surgical management in patients with VHL-associated tumors that are confined to an organ. It is unclear how belzutifan will be used in clinical practice and which providers will prescribe it to patients.<Reference refidx="76"/> </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_3278"><Title>VHL Management During Pregnancy</Title><Para id="_3279">Two studies have examined the effect of pregnancy
