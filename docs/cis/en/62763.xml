Risk increases dramatically after age 50 years; 90% of all CRCs are diagnosed after this age. Incidence and mortality rates are higher in African American individuals compared with other races. However, a meta-analysis found no evidence that African American individuals have higher rates of precancerous lesions.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> The history of CRC in a first-degree relative,   especially if diagnosed before the age of 55 years, roughly doubles the risk.  A personal history of CRC, high-risk adenomas, or ovarian cancer also increase the risk.<Reference refidx="3"/> Other risk factors for CRC have weaker associations than age and family history.  
People with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease, have a much higher risk of CRC starting about 8 years after disease onset and are recommended to have frequent colonoscopic surveillance.<Reference refidx="4"/>  A small percentage (&lt;5%) of CRCs occur in people with a genetic predisposition, including familial adenomatous polyposis  and Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis CRC).</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="30142339">Imperiale TF, Abhyankar PR, Stump TE, et al.: Prevalence of Advanced, Precancerous Colorectal Neoplasms in Black and White Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive aspirin (600 mg/day), aspirin-placebo, resistant starch (30 g/day), or starch-placebo for up to 4 years. A planned 10-year analysis of CAPP2 data found reduced CRC incidence in patients with Lynch syndrome who took aspirin for at least 2 years when compared with those who took placebo. An intention-to-treat analysis, using Cox proportional hazards regression, showed that aspirin protected against the primary end point of CRC (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43–0.97; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .035).<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_1186">In a randomized study of 635 patients with prior CRC (T1–T2 N0 M0) who had undergone curative resection,  ASA intake at 325 mg/day was associated with a decrease in the adjusted RR of any recurrent adenoma as compared with the placebo group (0.65; 95% CI, 0.46–0.91) after a median duration of treatment of 31 months.

A 2010 individual patient level data meta-analysis analyzed long-term (median follow-up, 18.3 years) data from four RCTs of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention; it found that allocation to use of 75 to 1,200 mg of daily ASA for at least one year reduced the cumulative risk of colon cancer death compared with controls (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.86). Aspirin reduced CRC mortality beginning 10 to 20 years after randomization, but not before.<Reference refidx="2"/> A 2011 individual participant level data meta-analysis examined data from six RCTs of primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.  In trials with allocation to ASA after at least 5 years of in-trial follow-up, the HR for CRC mortality was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.71–1.00).

Individual patient data for all in-trial cancer deaths were obtained. In the three United Kingdom trials, cancer deaths after completion of the trials were obtained via death certification and cancer registration, taking the follow-up to 20 years after randomization.  Based on meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) from each trial rather than on more sensitive actuarial analysis of the individual patient data, allocation to aspirin in the RCTs reduced the 20-year risk of death due to CRC.  ORs for maximum aspirin use were 0.55 for CRC risk (95% CI, 0.41–0.76) and for any aspirin use were 0.58 for CRC risk (95% CI, 0.44–0.78).<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_1190">The Women's Health Study, the largest randomized trial of aspirin to date (N = 39,876), found no reduction in CRC mortality rates with the use of every other day low-dose aspirin during the first 10 years of follow-up.

Regular low-dose aspirin use increases the risks for major gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial bleeding events, including hemorrhagic strokes.

Because no such exclusions (or baseline colonoscopy examinations) were done in the three comparison groups, individuals who had CRC at baseline would be counted as having incident CRC in subsequent follow-up.  Although adjustments were attempted, it is not possible to know the magnitude of the impact of this problem on the result because it is not known how long CRC may be present without causing symptoms.</Para><Para id="_1196">An additional long-term follow-up study (median follow-up, 15.8 years; maximum, 23 years) of the NPS cohort suggested an approximately 53% reduction in CRC mortality due to polypectomy (not just exclusion of individuals with CRC at initial exam). However, the degree of reduction must be viewed with caution because this study did not have a direct comparison group, relying mainly on comparison to expected data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program.  Further, details are not clear regarding factors that may have led to decreased mortality. Patients in the NPS were assigned to colonoscopy at years 1 and 3; colonoscopy was also offered to one of the two comparison groups at year 1; all participants were offered colonoscopy at year 6.  However, following year 6, the exact surveillance that patients may have undergone and how that surveillance might have been associated with decreased CRC mortality were not well described.<Reference refidx="21"/></Para><Para id="_1197">It is expected that further follow-up in the United Kingdom Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening Trial will be able to provide more detail about the long-term effect of polypectomy, at least on the left side of the colon.<Reference refidx="21"/></Para><Para id="_1198">Other evidence about the benefit of sigmoidoscopy screening (at which time both polyps and early cancer would be removed) suggests that the impact of endoscopic screening, at least on the left side of the colon, is substantial and prolonged.  In an RCT, 170,000 individuals were randomly assigned to one-time sigmoidoscopy versus usual care.  At sigmoidoscopy, polyps were removed, cancer was detected, and patients were referred for treatment.  Based on sigmoidoscopy findings, individuals were considered to have low risk if they had normal exams or only one or two small (&lt;1 cm) tubular adenomas. These individuals were not referred either for colonoscopy workup, or for colonoscopic surveillance.  In a follow-up of 10 years, the left-sided CRC incidence in the low-risk group (about 95% of attendees were low risk) was 0.02% to 0.04% per year—a very low risk of CRC compared with average risk.  The cause of reduced risk—whether due to detection and removal of large polyps or small ones, or selection of individuals at lower risk—is yet unclear.<Reference refidx="22"/>  The natural history of large polyps is not well known, but some evidence suggests that such lesions become clinical CRC at a rate of approximately 1% per year.<Reference refidx="23"/> As a result of the strong data about the impact of endoscopy on the left colon, evidence from multiple studies has raised questions about the ability of endoscopy to reduce CRC mortality in the right colon.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/>  Thus, it is unclear what the overall impact of endoscopy (e.g., colonoscopy screening) is, and whether there may be a large difference in impact on the left side of the colon compared with the right side.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_1199">Other studies suggest that the polyps with the greatest potential to progress to CRC are larger polyps (i.e., &gt;1.0 cm), which include most of those with villous or high-grade histological features.

Because exposure to non-ASA NSAIDs was assessed only once, assessment was by self-report, and there is no information on dose or duration of use, the certainty of this single study must be rated low.  Further research is needed before this finding can be accepted.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_1209">Although evidence is currently inadequate to determine whether NSAIDs reduce CRC incidence, proponents suggest that any effect of these drugs results from their ability to inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX). COX is important in the transformation of arachidonic acid into prostanoids, prostaglandins, and thromboxane A2. NSAIDs include not only aspirin (ASA, which is considered separately here) and other, first-generation nonselective inhibitors of the two functional isoforms of COX, termed COX-1 and COX-2, but also newer second-generation drugs that inhibit primarily COX-2. Normally, COX-1 is expressed in most tissues and primarily plays a housekeeping role (e.g., gastrointestinal mucosal protection and platelet aggregation). COX-2 activity is crucial in stress responses and in mediating and propagating the pain and inflammation that are characteristic of arthritis.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_1216">Nonselective COX inhibitors include indomethacin (Indocin); sulindac (Clinoril); piroxicam (Feldene); diflunisal (Dolobid); ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin); ketoprofen (Orudis); naproxen (Naprosyn); and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox).  Selective COX-2 inhibitors include celecoxib (Celebrex), rofecoxib (Vioxx), and valdecoxib (Bextra).

studied.   There are, however, several unresolved issues that preclude
making general recommendations for their use.  These include a paucity of
knowledge about the proper dose and duration for these agents, and concern
about whether the potential preventive benefits such as a reduction in the frequency or intensity of screening or surveillance  could counterbalance  long-term
risks such as gastrointestinal ulceration and hemorrhagic  stroke for the average-risk

placebo-controlled trial tested the effect of calcium supplementation (3 g
calcium carbonate daily [1,200 mg elemental calcium]) on the risk of recurrent
adenoma.<Reference refidx="17"/>  The primary end point was the proportion of patients (72% of whom
were male) in whom at least one adenoma was detected following a first and/or
second follow-up endoscopy.  A modest decrease in risk was found for both
developing at least one recurrent adenoma (adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 0.81; 95% CI,
0.67–0.99) and in the average number of adenomas (ARR, 0.76;
95% CI, 0.60–0.96). The investigators found the effect of calcium was similar
across age, sex, and baseline dietary intake categories of calcium, fat, or
fiber.  The study was limited to individuals with a recent history of
colorectal adenomas and  could not determine the effect of calcium on risk of
the first adenoma, nor was it large enough or of sufficient duration to examine
the risk of invasive CRC. After calcium supplementation is stopped, the lower risk may persist up to 5 years.<Reference refidx="18"/>  The results of other ongoing adenoma
recurrence studies are awaited with interest.  It is important to
note that the dose of calcium salt administered may be important; the usual
daily doses in trials have ranged from 1,250 to 2,000 mg of calcium.</Para><Para id="_1203">In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 36,282 postmenopausal women, the administration of 500 mg of elemental calcium and 200 IU of vitamin D3 twice daily for an average of 7.0 years was not associated with a reduction in invasive CRC (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.86–1.34; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .051).<Reference refidx="19"/>  The relatively short duration of follow-up, considering the latency period of CRC of 10 to 15 years, and suboptimal doses of calcium and vitamin D, may account for the negative effects of this trial, although other factors may also  be responsible.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1223"><Title>Dietary Factors</Title><SummarySection id="_1224"><Title>Dietary fat and meat intake</Title><Para id="_1225">Colon cancer rates are high in populations with high total fat intakes and
are lower in those consuming less fat.<Reference refidx="21"/>  On average, fat comprises 40% to
45% of total caloric intake in high-incidence Western countries; in low-risk
populations, fat accounts for only 10% of dietary calories.<Reference refidx="22"/>  Several case-control studies have explored the
association of colon cancer risk with meat or fat consumption, as well as
protein and energy intake.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/>  Although positive associations with meat
consumption or with fat intake have been found, the results have been inconsistent.<Reference refidx="25"/>  A number of prospective
cohort studies have been conducted in the United States and abroad; a systematic review of 13, including the Iowa Women’s Health Study and the Nurses’ Health Study, concluded that there appeared to be a positive association between meat consumption and CRC incidence. However, the authors noted that because only a few studies tried to investigate the independent effect of meat intake on cancer risk, the observed relationship might be attributed entirely to confounding.<Reference refidx="26"/>  Similarly, a 2019 systematic review of observational studies, evaluating the association between processed or unprocessed red meat consumption and CRC incidence and mortality, concluded that a reduction of three servings per week resulted in very small to no decreases in those outcomes, although the certainty around these findings was judged low to very low.<Reference refidx="27"/> </Para><Para id="_1226">A randomized controlled dietary modification study was undertaken among 48,835 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years who were also enrolled in the WHI. The intervention promoted a goal of reducing total fat intake by 20%, while increasing daily intake of vegetables, fruits, and grains. The intervention group accomplished a reduction of fat intake of approximately 10% more than did the comparison group during the 8.1 years of follow-up. There was no evidence of reduction in invasive CRCs between the intervention and comparison groups with an HR of 1.08 (95% CI, 0.90–1.29).<Reference refidx="28"/> Likewise, there was no benefit of the low-fat diet on all-cancer mortality, overall mortality, or cardiovascular disease.<Reference refidx="29"/> This last observation was echoed in a 2019 systematic review of randomized controlled trials of the effect of variable red meat consumption on cancer outcomes. This review relied heavily on the WHI to reach the conclusion that there appears to be little to no effect of red meat intake on CRC incidence, although the certainty around this finding is low because of limitations in available studies.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para><Para id="_1227">Explanations for the conflicting results regarding whether dietary fat or
meat intake affects the risk of CRC <Reference refidx="31"/> include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_1228" Style="bullet">

dietary risk factors for colorectal adenomas.<Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/>  Three of the eight studies found that higher fat consumption was associated with increased
risk.  High fat intake has been found to increase the risk of adenoma
recurrence following polypectomy.<Reference refidx="36"/>  In a multicenter RCT, a diet low in fat (20% of total calories) and high in fiber,
fruits, and vegetables did not reduce the risk of recurrence of colorectal
adenomas.<Reference refidx="37"/></Para><Para id="_1230">Thus, the evidence is inadequate to determine whether reducing dietary fat and meat would reduce CRC incidence.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="21407185">Ruder EH, Laiyemo AO, Graubard BI, et al.: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colorectal cancer risk in a large, prospective cohort.
