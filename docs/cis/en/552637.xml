More than 100 types of tumors are clinically apparent on the skin;  many of them have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460148" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">familial</GlossaryTermRef> components, either in isolation or as part of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000754220" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">syndrome</GlossaryTermRef> with other features. This is, in part,  because the skin itself is a complex organ made up of multiple cell types.  Furthermore, many of these cell types can undergo malignant transformation at various points in their differentiation, leading to tumors with distinct histology and dramatically different biological behaviors, such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell cancer (BCC).  These have been called nonmelanoma skin cancers or keratinocyte cancers.</Para><Para id="_83"><SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637#_250" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Figure 1</SummaryRef> is a simple diagram of normal skin structure.  It also indicates the major cell types that are normally found in each compartment. Broadly speaking, there are two large compartments—the avascular epidermis and the vascular dermis—with many cell types distributed in a connective tissue matrix, largely created by fibroblasts.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><MediaLink ref="CDR0000624959" type="image/jpeg" alt="Schematic representation of normal skin; drawing shows normal skin anatomy, including the epidermis, dermis, hair follicles, sweat glands, hair shafts, veins, arteries, fatty tissue, nerves, lymph vessels, oil glands, and subcutaneous tissue.

Schematic representation of normal skin.  The relatively avascular epidermis houses basal cell keratinocytes and squamous epithelial keratinocytes, the source cells for BCC and SCC, respectively.  Melanocytes are also present in normal skin and serve as the source cell for melanoma.   The separation between epidermis and dermis occurs at the basement membrane zone, located just inferior to the basal cell keratinocytes.</Caption></MediaLink><Para id="_84">The outer layer or epidermis is made primarily of keratinocytes but has several other minor cell populations. The bottom layer is formed of basal keratinocytes abutting the basement membrane, along with interspersed melanocytes. The basement membrane is formed from products of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, such as collagen and laminin, and is an important anatomical and functional structure. Basal keratinocytes lose contact with the basement membrane as they divide. As basal keratinocytes migrate toward the skin's surface, they progressively differentiate, lose their nuclei, and form the spinous cell layer; the granular cell layer; and the keratinized outer layer, or stratum corneum, which serves as a protective covering of the body.</Para><Para id="_232">The true cytologic origin of BCC is unclear.   BCC and basal cell keratinocytes share many histological similarities, as is reflected in the name. Alternatively, the outer root sheath cells of the hair follicle have also been proposed as the cell of origin for BCC.<Reference refidx="2"/> This is suggested by the fact that BCCs occur predominantly on hair-bearing skin. BCCs rarely metastasize but can invade tissue locally or regionally, sometimes traveling along nerves.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_233">Some debate remains about the origin of SCC; however, these cancers are likely derived from epidermal stem cells associated with the hair follicle.<Reference refidx="4"/> A variety of tissues, such as the lung and the uterine cervix,  can give rise to SCCs. This cancer has somewhat differing behavior depending on its tissue source. Even in cancer derived from the skin, SCC from different anatomic locations can have differing levels of aggressiveness; for example, SCC from glabrous (smooth, hairless) sun-exposed skin has a lower metastatic rate than SCC arising from the vermillion border of the lip or from scars.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_85">Additionally, in the epidermal compartment, melanocytes distribute singly along the basement membrane and can undergo malignant transformation into  melanoma.  Melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells and migrate to the epidermal compartment near the eighth week of gestational age. Melanocytes contain melanin, which is packaged into melanosomes and transported to nearby keratinocytes to induce pigmentation of the skin.  Melanin provides a barrier for the nuclei of keratinocytes against ultraviolet radiation and also plays a role in the immune system.<Reference refidx="5"/> </Para><Para id="_1177">Langerhans cells, or dendritic cells, are another cell type in the epidermis and have a primary function of antigen presentation. These cells reside in the skin for an extended period of time and respond to different stimuli, such as ultraviolet radiation or topical steroids, which cause them to migrate out of the skin.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_86">The dermis is largely composed of an extracellular matrix.  Prominent cell types and organelles in this compartment are fibroblasts, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, transient immune system cells, blood vessels, and nerves.  When malignant transformation occurs, fibroblasts form fibrosarcomas and endothelial cells form angiosarcomas, Kaposi sarcoma, or other vascular tumors. There are a number of immune cell types that move in and out of the skin to blood vessels and lymphatics; these include mast cells, lymphocytes, mononuclear cells, histiocytes, and granulocytes. These cells can increase in number in inflammatory diseases and can form tumors within the skin.  For example, urticaria pigmentosa is a condition that arises from mast cells and is occasionally associated with mast cell leukemia; cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is often confined to the skin throughout its course. Overall, 10% of leukemias and lymphomas have prominent expression in the skin.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_87">Epidermal appendages are also found in the dermal compartment. These are derivatives of the epidermal keratinocytes, such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and the sebaceous glands associated with the hair follicles.  These structures are generally formed in the first and second trimesters of fetal development. These  can form a large variety of benign or malignant tumors with diverse biological behaviors.  Several of these tumors are associated with familial syndromes.  Overall, there are dozens of different histological subtypes of these tumors associated with individual components of the adnexal structures.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_88">Finally, the subcutis is a layer that extends below the dermis with varying depth, depending on the anatomic location. This deeper boundary can include muscle, fascia, bone, or cartilage. The subcutis can be affected by inflammatory conditions such as panniculitis and malignancies such as liposarcoma.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_89">These compartments give rise to their own malignancies but are also the region of immediate adjacent spread of localized skin cancers from other compartments. The boundaries of each skin compartment are used to define the staging of skin cancers. For example, an <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> melanoma is confined to the epidermis. Once the cancer  crosses the basement membrane into the dermis, it is invasive. Internal malignancies also commonly metastasize to the skin. The dermis and subcutis are the most common locations, but the epidermis can also be involved in conditions such as Pagetoid breast cancer.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_90"><Title>Function of the Skin</Title><Para id="_91">The skin has a wide variety of functions.  First, the skin is an important barrier preventing extensive water and temperature loss and providing protection against minor abrasions.  These functions can be aberrantly regulated in cancer. For example, in the erythroderma (extensive reddening of the skin) associated with severe sunburn, alterations in the regulations of body temperature can result in profound heat loss. </Para><Para id="_1205">Second, the skin has important adaptive and innate immunity functions. In adaptive immunity, antigen-presenting cells engender T-cell responses consisting of increased levels of helper T cells (T<Subscript>H</Subscript>)1, T<Subscript>H</Subscript>2, or T<Subscript>H</Subscript>17.<Reference refidx="10"/> In innate immunity, the immune system produces numerous peptides with antibacterial and antifungal capacity.  Even small breaks in the skin can potentially lead to infection. The skin-associated lymphoid tissue  is one of the largest arms of the immune system and has a role in the prevention of infection. It may also be important in immune surveillance against cancer. Immunosuppression, such as when it is induced intentionally after solid-organ transplantation to reduce the risk of transplanted organ rejection, is a significant risk factor for skin cancer. The skin is  significant for communication through facial expression and hand movements. Unfortunately, areas of specialized function, such as the area around the eyes and ears, are common places for cancer to occur.  Even small cancers in these areas can lead to reconstructive challenges and have significant cosmetic and social ramifications.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_680"><Title>Clinical Presentation of Skin Cancers</Title><Para id="_636">While the appearance of any one skin cancer can vary, there are general  physical presentations that  can be used in screening. BCCs most commonly have a pearly rim  or can appear somewhat eczematous (for more information, see  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637#_854" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Figure 2</SummaryRef> and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637#_992" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Figure 3</SummaryRef>). They often ulcerate (for more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637#_854" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Figure 2</SummaryRef>). SCCs frequently have a thick keratin top layer (for more information, see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637#_850" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Figure 4</SummaryRef>). Both BCCs and SCCs are associated with a history of sun-damaged skin. Melanomas are characterized by dark pigment with asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, a diameter of more than 6 mm, and evolution (ABCDE criteria). For more information about ABCDE criteria, see <ExternalRef xref="https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin/melanoma-photos">What Does Melanoma Look Like?</ExternalRef> on  NCI's website.

Intermittent dosing schedules of vismodegib (8 weeks on/8 weeks off after an initial schedule of daily dosing for 24 weeks or 12 weeks on/8 weeks off) have also been shown to be effective in the reduction of BCCs in the BCNS population, although there has been no direct comparison between continuous dosing and intermittent dosing schedules.<Reference refidx="150"/> On the basis of the side-effect profile and rate of disease recurrence after discontinuation of the medication, additional study regarding optimal dosing of vismodegib is ongoing.</Para><Para id="_702"><LOERef href="CDR0000526277" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence (vismodegib): 1aii</LOERef></Para><Para id="_955">A phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the effects of oral nicotinamide (vitamin B<Subscript>3</Subscript>) in 386 individuals with a history of at least two  keratinocyte carcinomas (BCC or SCC) within 5 years before study enrollment.<Reference refidx="151"/>  After 12 months of treatment, those taking nicotinamide 500 mg twice daily had a 20% reduction in the incidence of new BCCs (95% CI, 6%–39%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .12).

Other XP patients do not have this reaction but develop freckle-like pigmentation before age 2 years on sun-exposed sites.

Neurological degeneration, which is most commonly observed in individuals with complementation groups XPA and XPD, was associated with a shorter lifespan (median age of death was 29 years in individuals with neurological degeneration and 37 years in individuals without neurological degeneration).<Reference refidx="49"/> A subset of patients who have the skin and eye manifestations associated with XP also exhibit severe neurological manifestations, dwarfism, and delayed development. This severe form of XP is known as De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome.   Individuals with XP may also experience differences with aging. In a small study, 18 postmenopausal women with XP had a high frequency of premature aging, with a median age of menopause occurring at 29.5 years  in the XP group (range, 18.0–49.5 y) and 52.9 years in the U.S. general population.<Reference refidx="52"/></Para><Para id="_1312">A variety of noncutaneous neoplasms–most notably SCC on the tip of the tongue, central nervous system cancers, hematologic cancers, thyroid cancers, gynecologic cancers, and lung cancers in smokers–have been reported in people with XP.<Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="53"/><Reference refidx="54"/> The RR for internal cancers is estimated to be 34- to 50-fold higher in individuals with XP than in individuals in the general population.<Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="54"/>  A report on 434 patients with XP in  four international cohorts (United States, United Kingdom, France, and Brazil) found an  internal cancers rate of 11.3% in individuals with XP, with the average age of diagnosis occurring 50 years earlier than that of individuals in the general U.S. population.

Several treatment methods were used in this prospective study, including topical therapy to the lesions, short systemic infusion with folic acid, and continuous systemic infusion in combination with cisplatin.  Topical 5-FU demonstrated some efficacy, but in some cases viable tumor remained in the deeper dermis. The systemic chemotherapy resulted in one complete response and three partial responses in a total of five patients, suggesting that this therapy may be an option for treatment of extensive lesions.<Reference refidx="262"/> A dose reduction of 30% to 50% has been recommended for systemic chemotherapeutic agents in this population because of the  increased sensitivity of XP cells.<Reference refidx="263"/></Para><Para id="_260"><LOERef href="CDR0000531844" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: 3diii</LOERef></Para><Para id="_1130">For patients with EB, wide local excision of SCC with 2 cm margins remains the treatment of choice. Because the extent of SCC may be difficult to assess in these patients, clearance of SCC tumors may require continuous margin control surgery (Mohs excision) or generous clinical margins. Multiple surgical sessions may be required. Closure of the subsequent defects may require tissue rearrangement or dermal substitutes.<Reference refidx="264"/>  Amputation may be considered as an option to reduce disease recurrence, although it is not clear that this has an impact on survival.

Careful protection of the skin and eyes is the mainstay of prevention in all patients with increased susceptibility to skin cancer. Key points include avoidance of sun exposure at peak hours, protective clothing and lenses, and vigilant use of sunscreen. Avoidance of x-ray therapy has also been advocated for some groups with hereditary skin cancer syndromes, such as those with epidermodysplasia verruciformis.<Reference refidx="158"/> However, XP patients with unresectable skin cancers or internal cancers, such as spinal cord astrocytoma or glioblastomas of the brain, have been treated successfully with standard therapeutic doses of x-ray radiation.<Reference refidx="53"/> Some experts recommend dermatologic evaluation every 6 months and ophthalmologic evaluation at least annually in these high-risk populations. Guidelines for the management of patients with EB recommend skin examinations every 3 to 6 months starting at age 10 years for individuals with the RDEB-sev gen subtype of the disease.<Reference refidx="260"/> For individuals with other subtypes of EB, skin examination every 6 to 12 months starting at age 20 years is recommended in the absence of an established SCC diagnosis.

Use of silver sulfadiazine cream, medical grade honey, and soft silicone dressings can be helpful in these settings.  Attention to nutritional status, which may be compromised because of esophageal strictures, iron-deficiency anemia, infection, and inflammation, is another critical consideration for wound healing for these patients.  Multivitamin supplementation, often at higher doses  than those routinely recommended for the general population, may be warranted.<Reference refidx="265"/>

The rationale for this study was that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to differentiate into dermal fibroblasts, the main expressor of type VII collagen. Seven subjects were randomly assigned to receive MSCs with 5 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine and an additional seven subjects received only MSCs.

At present, no proven effective means of pancreatic cancer screening is available for general population use. However, radiographic screening measures are recommended by expert groups in specific high-risk populations. The NCCN recommends that all patients with <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> pathogenic variants have pancreatic cancer surveillance with endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of the abdomen, regardless of whether they have family histories of pancreatic cancer.<Reference refidx="239"/>  The NCCN recommends starting annual pancreatic cancer surveillance at age 40 years or 10 years prior to the earliest pancreatic cancer diagnosis in the family (whichever occurs earlier).  These screening methods are often alternated so that EUS is done one year and MRI/MRCP is done the next year.  Use of both modalities on an asynchronous schedule is preferred, because MRI has a higher sensitivity for cystic lesions, whereas EUS has a higher sensitivity for solid lesions.<Reference refidx="240"/>  The International Cancer of the Pancreas Screening (CAPS) Consortium  issued revised guidelines in 2020 that recommend baseline EUS and MRI/MRCP, then alternating these screening modalities afterwards annually.<Reference refidx="241"/>  The CAPS recommendations agree with NCCN's recommendations  on the age to begin pancreatic cancer surveillance.
