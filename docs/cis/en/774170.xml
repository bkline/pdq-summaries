Generally, vascular tumors are proliferative, while vascular malformations enlarge through expansion of a developmental anomaly without underlying proliferation.  </Para><Para id="_2477">Although these anomalies are not oncological, it is important for oncologists to understand the biology and clinical management of common vascular malformations. This is because many vascular malformations are caused by targetable somatic variants, which means that pediatric oncologists will be asked to help manage these lesions. While information about vascular malformations is covered at the beginning of this summary, the remainder of this summary focuses on tumors, not malformations.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_385"><Title>Vascular Malformations</Title><Para id="_387">Vascular malformations are distinguished from vascular tumors by their low cell turnover and lack of invasiveness.<Reference refidx="1"/> They tend to grow in proportion to the child and are generally stable in adulthood. Nonetheless, endothelial cells isolated from vascular malformations have been found <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> to have some tumor-like behaviors, such as increased growth, migration, and resistance to apoptosis.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_388">In the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification, vascular malformations are subdivided according to vessel type.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Fast-flow lesions include arterial-venous fistulas and arterial-venous malformations. These complicated lesions can cause bleeding, ulceration, and organ dysfunction.</Para><Para id="_2446">Slow-flow lesions include venous, lymphatic, capillary, or combined lesions. Complications from slow-flow lesions include pain, infection, bleeding, thrombosis, and organ dysfunction.</Para><Para id="_2447">Regular monitoring and assessment of changes or development of symptoms is warranted in patients with vascular malformations. Treatment requires an interdisciplinary approach to care and includes observation, surgery, endovascular intervention, and medical management. Only a low level of evidence supports the choice of treatment between these options. Recurrence rates of these lesions are relatively high.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_389">Vascular malformations are most commonly caused by variants in the MAP2K/PIK3CA pathway. Most are activating somatic variants but, rarely, germline variants are identified. Approximately one-third to one-half of venous malformations result from somatic or, rarely, germline variants in the <GeneName>TEK</GeneName> (or <GeneName>TIE2</GeneName>) gene.<Reference refidx="5"/> Another one-third of venous malformations, and nearly all lymphatic malformations, are caused by somatic variants in <GeneName>PIK3CA</GeneName>.<Reference refidx="6"/> In most cases, <GeneName>PIK3CA</GeneName> variants are identical to canonical cancer variants.  Lesions harboring <GeneName>PIK3CA</GeneName> variants are frequently associated with overgrowth of adjacent tissues, as seen in patients with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome and CLOVES  syndrome (congenital lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal nevis, spinal/skeletal anomalies/scoliosis).<Reference refidx="7"/> </Para><Para id="_2453">Sirolimus was initially used to target the PI3K pathway in slow-flow malformations, leading to symptomatic improvement in many patients.  It is unclear whether treatment reduces the size of lesions because there is usually considerable fluctuation in size, and treatment generally begins when lesions are enlarged.  The use of sirolimus in venous and lymphatic malformations is supported by level C evidence (case series, other observational study designs, phase II studies).<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> Both lesions with <GeneName>PIK3CA</GeneName> and <GeneName>TEK</GeneName> variants appear to respond equally to treatment with sirolimus.  Phase III clinical trials are underway in Europe (e.g., <ProtocolRef nct_id="NCT02638389">NCT02638389</ProtocolRef>, <ProtocolRef nct_id="NCT03987152">NCT03987152</ProtocolRef>, and <ProtocolRef nct_id="NCT04980872">NCT04980872</ProtocolRef>).  A 2018 study reported promising level C evidence for the use of the PI3K inhibitor BYL719 (alpelisib) to treat patients who have lesions with a <GeneName>PIK3CA</GeneName> variant.<Reference refidx="11"/> From these studies, preliminary FDA approval has been obtained.

The lesion then lightens centrally and becomes less warm and  softer; it then flattens and loses its color. The process of involution can take several years and once involution has occurred, regrowth is uncommon. In two patients treated with growth hormone, regrowth after involution was noted.<Reference refidx="14"/>   On further investigation, growth hormone receptors were found on the infantile hemangioma cells. Although preliminary, this may advance the research into the etiology of hemangioma growth.</Para><Para id="_2462">Ulceration is the most common complication of infantile hemangiomas, occurring in 10% to 15% of patients. Ulceration typically occurs during the proliferative phase, and it can lead to bleeding and secondary infections.<Reference refidx="15"/> Most other complications in the proliferative phase result from the impact of the mass on local structures (e.g., visual or auditory compromise, airway obstruction).<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_329">Permanent sequelae, such as telangiectasia, anetodermal skin, redundant skin, and  a persistent superficial component, can occur after hemangioma involution.   Hemangiomas with a history of ulceration are more likely to cause scarring and potential local anatomical complications.<Reference refidx="15"/> Rare instances of dysesthesias in sites of involuted infantile hemangiomas in the absence of ulceration have been described.<Reference refidx="17"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000810035" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence C1</LOERef>] In a retrospective cohort study of 184 hemangiomas, the overall incidence of significant sequelae was 54.9%.

Furthermore, this study revealed that the average age to hemangioma involution was 3.5 years.<Reference refidx="18"/> Thus, prophylactic measures such as maintaining dermal integrity with moisturizing barrier agents are indicated for infantile hemangiomas and are important before and during the proliferative phase.<Reference refidx="16"/> Once an ulceration has occurred, it is important to aggressively manage the ulceration to promote healing, prevent infection, and treat pain.

Several cell types have been isolated from hemangiomas: progenitor/stem cells (HemSC), endothelial cells (HemEC), pericytes (HemPericytes), and mast cells.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/> These cells appear to play a role in the development of infantile hemangiomas.</Para><Para id="_433">HemSC represent a small percentage of proliferating hemangioma cells and have the ability for self renewal and multilineage differentiation. These cells differentiate into endothelial cells, adipocytes, and pericytes. When HemSC are implanted into immunodeficient mice,  hemangioma-like lesions form and then spontaneously regress, similar to infantile hemangiomas.<Reference refidx="23"/> This suggests that infantile hemangioma proliferation occurs during vasculogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from angioblasts), as opposed to angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from existing blood vessels).</Para><Para id="_422">HemEC  are plump, metabolically active, and resemble fetal endothelial cells in the proliferative phase.

These cells express markers of pericytes and smooth muscle cells, such as neural-glial antigen 2 (NG2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-beta), calponin, alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA), and NOTCH3. HemPericytes are proangiogenic, as they express increased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), decreased angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1), increased proliferation, increased vessel formation <Emphasis>in vivo</Emphasis>, and decreased ability to suppress proliferation.<Reference refidx="26"/> One study reported that proliferating infantile hemangiomas contained higher levels of messenger RNA, proteins for NOTCH1, 3, and 4 receptors and their ligands, and the downstream coactivator <GeneName>MAML1</GeneName> than did normal skin, involuting infantile hemangiomas, and propranolol-treated infantile hemangiomas.<Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_396">Mast cells are found largely in the early involuting phase, but they are also found in small numbers in the proliferative phase and at the end of involution.

Of 153 individuals who were contacted,  104 participated in the study (68%). The median age was 14 years (range, 10–77 years). This study found that PHACE syndrome was associated with long-term, mild-to-severe morbidities, including infantile hemangioma residua (94.1%), headaches/migraines (72.1%), learning differences (45.1%), and progressive arteriopathy (29.4%). Additional findings from the study are reported in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000774170#_2471" url="/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/hp/child-vascular-tumors-treatment-pdq">Table 3</SummaryRef>. <Para id="_2474">Most patients with hemangioma residua were satisfied or very satisfied with their appearance (89.5%). Those with surgery and/or ulceration were less likely to report a minimal impact on self-confidence. Of the 68 patients with arteriopathy and available follow-up imaging, 6 (8.8%) developed moyamoya vasculopathy or progressive stenoocclusion, leading to isolated circulation at or above the level of the circle of Willis. Despite this finding, the proportion of patients with ischemic stroke was low (2 of 104; 1.9%). Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) global health scores were lower than population norms by at least 1 standard deviation. Given the overall prevalence of PHACE, it was not possible to obtain the proper power to accurately assess all outcomes. The authors of the study concluded that primary and specialty follow-up care is important for  patients with PHACE into adulthood.

These lesions can arise spontaneously, in sites of trauma, or within capillary  and arteriovenous malformations.

These lesions are usually cutaneous, but deep-seated/subcutaneous pyogenic granulomas have been reported and mimic other vascular lesions.<Reference refidx="182"/> Histologically, these lesions are composed of capillaries and venules with plump endothelial cells separated into lobules by fibromyxoid stroma. Some untreated lesions eventually atrophy, become fibromatous, and slowly regress.

The risk of developing Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is highest in patients with congenital lesions,  lesions larger than 6 to 8 cm, deeper lesions, and when kaposiform hemangioendothelioma arises in the retroperitoneum or mediastinum.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> This condition is characterized by profound thrombocytopenia (range, 3,000/µL–60,000/µL) and hypofibrinogenemia (&lt;1 g/L). D-dimer and fibrin degradation products are elevated.   Severe anemia can occur secondary to tumor sequestration. Severe hemorrhage is rare;  however, trauma (biopsy, surgical procedure), ulceration, infection, or delay in initiating treatment may induce progression to disseminated intravascular coagulation,  serious bleeding, and even death.  Aggressive replacement of blood products, especially platelets, can increase the size of the lesion, causing significant pain and should only be considered with active bleeding and under the direction of a vascular anomalies specialist.<Reference refidx="3"/> The mortality rate is unclear but it has been reported to be as high as 30%.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_75"><Title>Histopathology</Title><Para id="_76">Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is characterized by sheets of spindle cells with an infiltrative pattern in the dermis, subcutaneous fat, and muscle. There are often areas of fibrosis, with dilated thin-walled vessels infiltrated around the areas of spindle cells. Mixed within these areas are nests of rounded epithelioid cells of vascular origin and aggregates of capillaries with round or irregularly shaped lumens containing platelet-rich fibrin thrombi. There are usually abnormal lymphatic spaces, either within or at the periphery of the lesion. The rate of mitosis is usually low but can be variable.  Tufted angioma is characterized by multiple, discrete lobules of tightly packed capillaries (tufts) scattered in the dermis and sometimes in the subcutis, a so-called cannonball pattern.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Mitoses are rare.</Para><Para id="_77">The pathogenesis is poorly understood.  There is some evidence that kaposiform hemangioendothelioma may be derived from lymphatic endothelium, as the spindle cell expresses the vascular markers CD31 and CD34, the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) (a receptor required for lymphangiogenesis), and the lymphatic markers D2-40 and PROX1.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> There is no evidence of association with human herpesvirus 8 infection as is present in Kaposi sarcoma.<Reference refidx="10"/> </Para><Para id="_453">Genomic data are limited.

The Ang-2 levels have also been noted to decrease in response to therapy with sirolimus, which raises the possibility of an effect on the endothelial cells of the kaposiform hemangioendothelioma tumor.<Reference refidx="13"/> Ang-2 is produced and stored in the endothelial cells and acts as a TEK tyrosine kinase antagonist.  Ang-2 can promote neovascularization in conjunction with VEGF, and in humans, Ang-2 is greatly increased in vascular remodeling that occurs with sepsis, inflammation, and lymphangiogenesis.<Reference refidx="14"/> These levels have been used for the diagnosis of vascular tumors and assessment of response to therapy.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_81"><Title>Diagnostic evaluation</Title><Para id="_82">The diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical, histological, and imaging features. Laboratory evaluation is essential for the diagnosis of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon.
Whenever possible, histological confirmation should be obtained, because prolonged therapy is often needed. However, if clinical and imaging findings are highly suggestive of the diagnosis, deferring biopsy may be an option, but this decision should be reached via an interdisciplinary discussion and approach.</Para><Para id="_207">
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging modality, especially for kaposiform hemangioendothelioma with Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon and large lesions. T1-weighted sequences typically show a poorly circumscribed soft tissue mass with soft tissue and dermal thickening and diffuse enhancement with gadolinium. T2-weighted sequences show a diffuse increased signal, with stranding in the subcutaneous fat. Gradient sequences show mildly dilated vessels in and around the soft-tissue mass.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_414">For small and superficial lesions, ultrasonography can be useful for diagnosis and can distinguish tufted angioma from kaposiform hemangioendothelioma.  Tufted angiomas are more superficial, with well-defined borders and are hyperechoic. Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma has a more infiltrative pattern, with ill-defined borders and mixed echogenicity.
