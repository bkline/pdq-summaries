that can present as a pulmonary or pleural mass. In most cases, pleuropulmonary blastoma is associated with germline pathogenic variants of the <GeneName>DICER1</GeneName> gene. The <ExternalRef xref="https://www.ppbregistry.org/">International Pleuropulmonary Blastoma/DICER1 Registry</ExternalRef> is a valuable resource for information about this rare malignancy.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_1218">The following subtypes of pleuropulmonary blastoma have been identified:</Para><SummarySection id="_2423"><Title>Type I</Title><Para id="_2424">Type I pleuropulmonary blastoma is a purely lung cystic neoplasm with subtle malignant changes that typically occurs in the first 2 years of life. Patients have a good prognosis. The median age at diagnosis for Type I tumors is 7 months,<Reference refidx="3"/> and there is a slight male predominance. Transition from Type I to Type III occurs. However, a significant proportion of Type I lesions may not progress to Type II and Type III tumors.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_1396">Histologically, these tumors appear as a multilocular cyst with variable numbers of primitive mesenchymal cells beneath a benign epithelial surface. Skeletal differentiation occurs in one-half of the cases.<Reference refidx="4"/> This form of disease can be clinically and pathologically deceptive because of its resemblance to some developmental lung cysts, with over 10% discordance between local and central pathology review.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2425"><Title>Type Ir</Title><Para id="_2426">Type Ir was originally recognized in older siblings of patients with pleuropulmonary blastoma but can also be seen in very young children. A lung cyst in an older individual with a <GeneName>DICER1</GeneName> variant or in a relative of a patient with pleuropulmonary blastoma is most likely to be Type Ir.<Reference refidx="2"/> This is a purely cystic tumor that lacks a primitive cell component. The <Strong>r</Strong> designation signifies regression or nonprogression. In the National Cancer Institute Natural History of <GeneName>DICER1</GeneName>  Syndrome study and the International Pleuropulmonary Blastoma/<GeneName>DICER1</GeneName> Registry, people with germline <GeneName>DICER1</GeneName> pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants who did not have computed tomography (CT) scans before age 12 years were screened with chest CT. Cystic lesions were identified in 38% of individuals (42 of 110). Five cysts were resected, four of which were classified as Type Ir. The other cysts were not biopsied to confirm the Type Ir diagnosis.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_2105">In the International Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Registry, most Type I and Type Ir cysts are unilateral (74%), one-half are unifocal, and 55% are larger than 5 cm. Pneumothorax may be present at diagnosis in up to 30% of Type I and Type Ir pleuropulmonary blastoma cases.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2427"><Title>Type II</Title><Para id="_2428">In the International Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Registry, the median age at diagnosis is 35 months, and distant metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 7% of patients.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_2106">Type II exhibits both cystic and solid components. The solid areas have mixed blastomatous and sarcomatous features.

pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents

these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
