However, folliculin, the protein product of <GeneName>FLCN</GeneName>, has been implicated as a component of the cellular energy–sensing system. Folliculin, in association with either of two novel folliculin-interacting proteins, FNIP1 and FNIP2, interacts with AMPK.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>
AMPK is a major cellular energy and nutrient sensor that regulates the activity of mTOR in response to these stimuli.<Reference refidx="4"/> Additionally, both folliculin and FNIP1 are phosphorylated by AMPK, although the significance of this posttranslational modification is not clearly understood. The C-terminal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460145" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">domain</GlossaryTermRef> of FLCN is required for its interaction with FNIP1 and FNIP2.

Tissue-specific activation of mTORC1 was demonstrated in a kidney-specific <GeneName>FLCN</GeneName> knockout mouse model.<Reference refidx="6"/> In this model, both mTORC1 and mTORC2 were activated in renal tumors that developed in <GeneName>FLCN</GeneName> heterozygous knockout mice subsequent to loss of the wild-type allele,<Reference refidx="7"/> suggesting that mTOR may play a role in the development of BHD-related tumors.
A subsequent study suggested that aerobic glycolysis is upregulated as a consequence of <GeneName>FLCN</GeneName> inactivation. This glycolytic shift, although moderate, appears to be a consequence of constitutive AMPK activation in <GeneName>FLCN</GeneName>-null cells. AMPK activation has been shown to upregulate hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) and is well studied as a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390290" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">transcriptional</GlossaryTermRef> activator of several <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693" dictionary="Genetics" audience="Health professional">genes</GlossaryTermRef> necessary for aerobic glycolysis.<Reference refidx="8"/> More research on the mechanism(s) of the tumor suppressor function of <GeneName>FLCN</GeneName> is required.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="15956655">Vocke CD, Yang Y, Pavlovich CP, et al.: High frequency of somatic frameshift BHD gene mutations in Birt-Hogg-Dubé-associated renal tumors.

Therapy is dictated by the underlying lung condition and general health of the patient.   One study reported that of 101 patients with spontaneous pneumothoraces, 78 required medical intervention, and 23 were managed by observation alone.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Thirty-five percent of patients with pneumothoraces were treated with tube thoracostomy (chest tube) only; 14%  were treated by open thoracotomy and a second treatment, including mechanical or chemical pleurodesis and lung resection; and  approximately 13%  were treated with combined tube thoracostomy, thoracotomy, and a third treatment, including mechanical or chemical pleurodesis or lung resection.  Patients with BHD—especially those with multiple lung cysts—should be advised to avoid or be cautious  with scuba diving, air travel, and mechanical ventilation because each exposure increases the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_760"><LOERef href="CDR0000531845" dictionary="NotSet" audience="Health professional">Level of evidence: 4</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="11176677">Jacob CI, Dover JS: Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome: treatment of cutaneous manifestations with laser skin resurfacing.
