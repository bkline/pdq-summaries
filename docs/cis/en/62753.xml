the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States.<Reference refidx="2"/>     It is
estimated that in   2025 there will be 154,270 new cases diagnosed in the United States and    52,900 deaths due to this disease.  From 2012 to 2021, incidence rates for CRC declined by about 1% per year overall due to screening uptake and changing patterns in risk factors. However, this declining incidence is confined to individuals aged 65 years and older. Between 2012 and 2021, incidence rates increased by 2.4% per year in individuals younger than 55 years and by 0.4% per year in individuals aged 50 to 64 years. Over the last decade, the mortality rate from CRC
declined by  1.7% per year in both men and women.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Incidence is higher in men than in women.  The incidence rates range from   34.5 per 100,000 per
year in Asian or Pacific Islander men to 53.6 per 100,000 per year in American Indian or Alaska Native men.  In women, the incidence rates range from
  25.3 per 100,000 per year in Asian or Pacific Islander women to 45.5  per 100,000 per year in American Indian or Alaska Native women.

 The 
age-adjusted mortality rates are  15.4  per 100,000 per year in men and  10.8  per 100,000 per year in
women.  About 4.0% of Americans are expected to develop the disease within
their lifetime, and the lifetime risk of dying from CRC is 1.4%.<Reference refidx="3"/> Age-specific incidence and mortality rates show that  most
cases are diagnosed after age 54 years and 77% of cases occur in individuals aged 55 years and older; about 15% of CRC cases occur in individuals aged 45 to 54 years.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_377">An analysis of national data for 1975 to 2010 addressed long-term trends in CRC.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Incidence increased for men from 1975 to 1985, but there were marked declines from 1985 to 1995 for both men and women, followed by a nonsignificant increase from 1995 to 1998, then marked declines from 1998 to 2010.  Death rates from CRC have declined since 1984 in both men and women, with an accelerated rate of decline since 2002 for men and since 2001 for women.  From 1997 to 2010, CRC incidence declined for all racial and ethnic groups.  The fastest annual rate of decline occurred in men and women aged 65 years or older. There was a trend of increasing short-term incidence rates for individuals younger than 50 years in most population subgroups.  Incidence rates of distal colon and rectal cancers decreased in men and women for all ages combined.  Incidence rates of proximal colon cancer also decreased in men and women for all races and ethnicities combined.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_410"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><SummarySection id="_411"><Title>Age and family history</Title><Para id="_412">The main risk factor for CRC is increasing age; 90% of all CRCs are diagnosed after age 50 years.  History of CRC in a first-degree relative, especially when diagnosed before age 55 years, approximately doubles the risk.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_413"><Title>Adenomas</Title><Para id="_414">The presence of adenomas (lesions considered to be the histological [neoplastic but nonmalignant] precursors of CRC) is another major risk factor.  Adenomas are extremely common. For example, in individuals older than 50 years, the prevalence of adenomas is approximately 30%  but can be as high as 50% with the use of high-definition endoscopes, which can detect 1-mm to 2-mm adenomas.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Adenomas confer risk as they may themselves evolve into CRC.  Additionally, even after removal, an adenoma (particularly if it is <Strong>high risk</Strong> based on size and histology) may indicate future risk of CRC.  Managing adenomas and risk is challenging because adenomas are prevalent as people age, but most will never become CRC.</Para><Para id="_425">Understanding risk and risk management has been complicated by the intense focus on <Strong>adenoma-detection rates</Strong> in the last 15 years, which has led to increased detection of adenomas, especially very small ones (&lt;0.5 cm). Risk factors for developing CRC are not completely understood, but generally include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_426" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Personal history of CRC or high-risk adenomas.</ListItem><ListItem>Large adenomas (&gt;1 cm).</ListItem><ListItem>Multiple adenomas (&gt;3).</ListItem><ListItem>Adenomas with an advanced or worrisome histology (severe dysplasia; serrated, especially in the proximal colon).</ListItem><ListItem>Flat or difficult-to-detect lesions (including serrated polyps, which may be more common in the right colon than in the left colon.)</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_415">Increased future risk of CRC is indicated by a personal history of CRC or high-risk adenomas (i.e., large [&gt;1 cm] tubular adenomas, sessile-serrated adenomas, or multiple adenomas). Follow-up of individuals with these adenomas after they have undergone screening is considered <Strong>surveillance</Strong> and not screening.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_424">The term <Strong>serrated polyp</Strong> includes hyperplastic polyps, sessile-serrated adenomas, traditional-serrated adenomas, and mixed-serrated polyps.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/> The clinical significance of these lesions is uncertain because the natural history of any polypoid lesion is difficult to learn. However, the histological and molecular characteristics of some serrated lesions suggest possibly important malignant potential (e.g., mutations in the <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> gene may be an early step toward carcinogenesis in serrated polyps).<Reference refidx="12"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_417"><Title>Prevalence of adenomas and CRC in asymptomatic populations</Title><Para id="_418">In a colonoscopy study of 3,121 predominantly male U.S. veterans (mean age, 63
years), advanced neoplasia (defined as an adenoma ≥10 mm in
diameter, a villous adenoma, an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, or invasive
cancer) was identified in 10.5% of the individuals.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Among patients with no
adenomas distal to the splenic flexure, 2.7% had advanced proximal neoplasia. 
Patients with large adenomas (≥10 mm) or small adenomas (&lt;10 mm) in the
distal colon were more likely to have advanced proximal neoplasia (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 90% confidence interval [CI], 1.8–6.5) than were
patients with no distal adenomas (OR, 2.6; 90% CI,
1.7–4.1).  One-half of those with advanced proximal neoplasia had no
distal adenomas.  In a study of 1,994 adults aged 50 years or older who
underwent colonoscopy screening as part of a program sponsored by an employer,
5.6% of adults had advanced neoplasms.<Reference refidx="7"/>  Forty-six percent of those with advanced
proximal neoplasms had no distal polyps (hyperplastic or adenomatous).  If
colonoscopy screening had been performed only in patients with distal polyps, about
one-half of the cases of advanced proximal neoplasia would not have been detected.</Para><Para id="_419">Analysis of data from a colonoscopy-based screening program in Warsaw, Poland, demonstrated higher rates of advanced neoplasia in men than in women.  Of the 43,042 participants aged 50 to 66 years, advanced neoplasia was detected in 5.9% of participants (5.7% in women with a family history of CRC, 4.3% in women without a family history of CRC, 12.2% in men with a family history of CRC, and 8.0% in men without a family history of CRC).</Para><Para id="_421">In a cohort study within the Polish Colonoscopy Screening Program, nearly 166,000 participants were followed for up to 17 years after a single negative colonoscopy. Standardized incidence ratios that compared the participants to the general population were 0.32 (95% CI, 0.29–0.35) for low-quality colonoscopy (LQC) and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.13–0.20) for high-quality colonoscopy (HQC). Standardized mortality ratios were 0.22 (95% CI, 0.18–0.25) for LQC and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.06–0.14) for HQC. Colonoscopy, especially HQC, was predictive of low CRC incidence and mortality for at least 10 years after a negative exam, suggesting that the currently recommended 10-year interval for screening is safe and could potentially be extended.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="38572751">Bray F, Laversanne M, Sung H, et al.: Global cancer statistics 2022: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries.

The first generation of FOBTs used guaiac-based assays to detect blood, which are less sensitive and less specific than immunochemical-based testing.  The now-classic randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality reduction all used guaiac-based testing.  The finding of decreased CRC mortality provided a major foundation to draft CRC screening recommendations.  The first-generation guaiac-based tests are being replaced with more sensitive and more specific immunochemical tests, which have not yet been assessed in RCTs with a no-screening control group.</Para><Para id="_286">In this setting, the RCT evidence about guaiac-based testing is reviewed briefly here, with further discussion of how immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT or FIT) may provide improved sensitivity and specificity.  Generally, if guaiac FOBT (gFOBT) is acceptable as a screening test (as shown in RCTs), then a strong case can be made for using a more sensitive and more specific test like FIT.</Para><Para id="_287">gFOBT collection details vary somewhat for different tests, but they typically involve collection of as many as three different specimens on 3 different days, with small amounts from one specimen smeared by a wooden stick on a card with two windows or otherwise placed in a specimen container.</Para><Para id="_234">The guaiac test identifies peroxidase-like activity that is characteristic of human and nonhuman hemoglobin.  Thus, the test records blood from ingested meat, upper airway bleeding such as epistaxis, upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and colonic lesions.</Para><Para id="_288">A systematic review regarding evidence of benefit was conducted through the Cochrane Collaboration. It examined all CRC screening randomized trials that involved gFOBT testing done on more than one occasion.   The combined results showed that trial participants allocated to screening had a 16% lower CRC   mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78–0.90).  There was no difference in all-cause mortality between the screened groups and the control groups (RR, 1.00;   95% CI, 0.99–1.02). The trials reported a low positive predictive value (PPV)  for the FOBT test, suggesting that most positive tests were false positives.   The PPV was 5.0% to 18.7% in the trials using nonrehydrated slides (Funen and Nottingham studies), and it was 0.9% to 6.1% in the trials using rehydrated slides (Goteborg and Minnesota studies).  The report contained  no discussion about contamination in the control arms of the trials and no information about treatment by disease stage.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_289">On initial (prevalence) examinations, 1% to 5% of unselected
individuals tested with gFOBT had positive test results.  Of those who tested positive, approximately 2% to 10% had cancer and approximately 20% to 30%
had adenomas,<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> depending on how the test was done.  Data from RCTs of gFOBT testing are summarized in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062753#_55" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-screening-pdq">Table 2</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_19">Four controlled clinical trials  to evaluate the efficacy of screening with gFOBT have been completed or are in progress. While more sensitive stool blood tests based on measuring human hemoglobin have been developed (and are discussed later in this summary), results of their performance in RCTs have not yet been reported.  For gFOBT,  the Swedish trial was a targeted study for individuals aged 60 to 64 years.<Reference refidx="5"/>  The English trial selected candidates from lists of family
practitioners.<Reference refidx="6"/>  The Danish trial offered screening to a population aged 45
to 75 years who were randomly assigned to a control or study group.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> 
</Para><Para id="_20">The Minnesota trial randomly assigned 46,551 men and women aged 50 to 80 years  to one of three arms:  (1) CRC screening with gFOBT, (2) rehydrated (with some small percentage of unrehydrated) FOBT every year (n = 15,570) or (3) every 2 years (n = 15,587), or a control group (n = 15,394). This trial demonstrated that annual FOBT screening decreased mortality from CRC by 33% after 18 years of follow-up (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.83, compared with the control group) and
that biennial testing resulted in a 21% relative mortality reduction (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62–0.97).<Reference refidx="9"/>   Some part of the reduction may have been attributed to chance
detection of cancer by colonoscopies; rehydration of guaiac test slides greatly
increased positivity and consequently increased the number of colonoscopies performed.<Reference refidx="10"/> 
Subsequent analyses by the Minnesota investigators using mathematical modeling
suggested that for 75% to 84% of the patients, mortality reduction was achieved
because of sensitive detection of CRCs by the test; chance
detection played a  modest role (16%–25% of the reduction).<Reference refidx="11"/>  Nearly 85% of
patients with a positive test underwent diagnostic procedures that included
colonoscopy or double-contrast barium enema plus flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS).   After
18 years of follow-up, the incidence of CRC was reduced by 20% in
the annually screened arm and 17% in the biennially screened arm. With follow-up through 30 years, there was a sustained reduction in CRC mortality of 32% in the annually screened arm (RR,  0.68; 95% CI, 0.56–0.82) and 22% in the biennially screened arm (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93).  There was no reduction in all-cause mortality in either screened arm (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99–1.01 for the annually screened arm and RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98–1.01 for the biennially screened arm).<Reference refidx="12"/>   Important information that was not reported includes the treatment of CRC cases by stage by arm and the extent of CRC screening in each arm by  FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy after the completion of the trial protocol.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_21">The English trial allocated approximately 76,000 individuals to each arm. 
Those in the screened arm were offered nonrehydrated gFOBT   testing every 2 years
for three to six rounds from 1985 to 1995.  At a median follow-up of 7.8 years, 60% completed at least one test,    and 38% completed all tests.  Cumulative
incidence of CRC was similar in both arms, and the trial reported an RR  reduction of 15% in CRC mortality (odds ratio
[OR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74–0.98).<Reference refidx="14"/>   The
serious complication rate of colonoscopy was 0.5%.  There were five deaths within
30 days of surgery for screen-detected CRC or adenoma in a
total of 75,253 individuals screened.<Reference refidx="15"/>

Participants in the control group were not contacted and were unaware they were part of the trial.  Screening was offered at different frequencies to three different cohorts according to year of birth.  Screening was done using the gFOBT Hemoccult-II test after dietary restriction.  Nearly 92% of tests were rehydrated.  Individuals with a positive test result were invited to an examination consisting of a case history, FS, and  double-contrast barium enema.  Follow-up ranged from 6 years 7 months to 19 years 5 months, depending on the date of enrollment. The primary end point was CRC-specific mortality. The overall screening compliance rate was 70%, and 47.2% of participants completed all screenings.  Of the 2,180 participants with a positive test, 1,890 (86.7%) underwent a complete diagnostic evaluation with 104 cancers and 305 adenomas of at least 10 mm detected.  In total, there were 721 CRCs (152 Dukes D, 184 Dukes C) in the screening group and 754 CRCs (161 Dukes D, 221 Dukes C) in the control group, with an incidence ratio of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86–1.06). Deaths from CRC  were 252 in the screening group and 300 in the control group, with a mortality ratio of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.71–0.99).  This CRC mortality difference emerged after 9 years of follow-up.

The advantage of  FIT over gFOBT is that it does not detect hemoglobin from nonhuman dietary sources.  Also, FIT does not detect partly digested human hemoglobin that comes from the upper respiratory or GI tract.  Preliminary studies of several commercially developed  FIT tests define their sensitivity and specificity compared with concurrently performed colonoscopy.  The studies also examine these outcomes for different cutpoints, and the benefit of multiple versus single stool samples.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_344">Overall, FIT testing is much more sensitive than gFOBT, and it is more sensitive for cancers than for benign neoplasias. As expected, higher cutpoints decrease sensitivity and increase specificity. Fecal immunochemical tests may vary with regard to numbers of stools tested and cutoff values for a positive result.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_391">A systematic review of FIT studies in 2019  found 31 studies, with 120,255 participants and 18 types of FIT tests, that used screening colonoscopy as the reference standard, thus allowing calculation of test sensitivity and specificity.<Reference refidx="27"/> Performance depended on the threshold for a positive result, so that a threshold of 10 µg/g (micrograms of hemoglobin per gram of feces) resulted in a CRC sensitivity of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84–0.95) and a specificity of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86–0.93), while a threshold greater than 20 µg/g resulted in a sensitivity of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.56–0.83) with specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94–0.96).  For advanced adenomas, at a threshold of 10 µg/g, sensitivity was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.33–0.47) with a specificity of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.93). Comparison of three FITs at three thresholds was inconclusive because CIs overlapped, and the comparisons were across rather than within studies.  Overall, FIT appears to provide a substantially improved sensitivity compared with gFOBT, although with some compromise in specificity.</Para><Para id="_389">The diagnostic sensitivity of FIT testing may vary depending on lesion location in the colon.  Proximal lesions may be harder to detect for several reasons, including that they may arise from <Strong>serrated lesions</Strong> that are flat and, because they are less vascular than traditional adenomas, tend to bleed less frequently.  In a population-based screening program of every-other-year FIT (set to detect 100 ng of hemoglobin per mL of buffer) testing, individuals who had six FITs over time were assessed to learn the frequency with which proximal and distal lesions were discovered.<Reference refidx="28"/>  Over 12 years (2002–2014), 123,000 participants had 441,000 FITs.  The detection rate for proximal colon cancer declined only from the first to the second screening round (0.63–0.36 per 1,000 screened participants), while the rate for both distal colon and rectal cancer decreased across all six rounds (distal cancer, 1.65 in the first round to 0.17 in the sixth round). (Similar trends occurred for advanced adenomas.) The proportional interval cancer rate—the number of cancers observed versus expected—was higher in the proximal colon than in the distal colon (25.2% vs. 6.0%), suggesting that many proximal cancers (or their immediate precursors) may have been missed by FIT.  These results suggest that FIT is less sensitive for proximal CRC and certainly for advanced adenomas, although it is possible that the miss rate may have been inflated if colonoscopy done in response to a positive FIT had missed a precursor lesion.  Overall, these results raise questions about the degree of efficacy of FIT in preventing proximal CRC mortality.</Para><Para id="_332">The performance and acceptability of FIT over time was assessed by Kaiser-Permanente of Northern and Southern California in a screening program.  A retrospective cohort of 323,349 persons aged 50 to 70 years was followed for up to four screening rounds over 4 years.  Of patients invited, participation in round one was 48.2%, and of those remaining eligible, 75.3% to 86.1% participated in subsequent rounds.  The authors reported that “programmatic FIT screening detected 80.4% of patients with CRC diagnosed within 1 year of testing, including 84.5% in round one and 73.4% to 78.0% in subsequent rounds.”  An important observation was the degree of participation found.  One limitation of the study is that it was not clear how work-up bias was addressed; e.g., when individuals with a positive test result are preferentially worked up to ascertain the presence or absence of CRC, while individuals with a negative test, but who might have CRC, are not.  Although a <Strong>look-back</Strong> method was used to ascertain whether an individual had cancer, it is not clear that the duration of follow-up was long enough to discover everyone who should have been included in the denominator of the sensitivity calculation.  Nevertheless, the results suggested that subsequent FIT results were at least partially independent of previous results. Longer follow-up may help clarify this issue.  Mortality reduction could not be assessed in this study.<Reference refidx="29"/>

</Para><Para id="_206">Potential false-positive test results because of an increased risk of upper GI bleeding are of concern with FOBT testing and pretest protocols, therefore; low-dose aspirin regimens are discontinued for a week or more before FOBT.  The performance of FIT was tested in an ongoing diagnostic study (2005–2009) at 20 internal medicine GI practices in southern Germany.  Nineteen hundred seventy-nine patients (233 regular low-dose aspirin users and 1,746 never users) were identified in the records for inclusion in the analysis.  All patients provided one stool sample taken within a week before colonoscopy preparation, which was collected according to instructions in a container that was kept refrigerated or frozen until rendered to the clinic on the day of colonoscopy, and the patients agreed to complete a standard questionnaire regarding the use of analgesics and low-dose aspirin (for prevention of cardiovascular disease).  Stool samples were thawed within a median of 4 days after arrival at the central laboratory (shipped frozen from the recipient clinics).  Fecal occult blood levels were measured by two automated FIT tests according to the manufacturer’s instructions (RIDASCREEN Haemoglobin and RIDASCREEN Haemo-/Haptoglobin Complex, r-biopharm, Bensheim, Germany) following clinical procedures and blinded to colonoscopy results.  Advanced neoplasms were found in 24 aspirin users (10.3%) and in 181 nonusers (10.4%).  At the cut point recommended by the manufacturer, sensitivities for the two tests were as follows: 70.8% (95% CI, 48.9%–87.4%) for users compared with 35.9% (95% CI, 28.9%–43.4%) for nonusers for the Haemoglobin test (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .001) and 58.3% (95% CI, 36.6%–77.9%) for users compared with 32% (95% CI, 25.3%–39.4%) for nonusers for the Haemo-/Haptoglobin test (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .01).  Specificities were as follows: 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2%–90.1%) for users compared with 89.2% (95% CI, 87.6%–90.7%) for nonusers for the Haemoglobin test (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .13) and 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2%–90.1%) for users compared with 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5%–92.4%) for nonusers for the Haemo-/Haptoglobin test (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .01).  For these FITs, sensitivity for advanced neoplasms was notably higher with the use of low-dose aspirin while specificity was only slightly reduced, suggesting that there might be an advantage of aspirin use to increase sensitivity without much decrease in specificity.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_32"><Title>Sigmoidoscopy</Title><Para id="_33">The flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscope was introduced in 1969.

Men and women aged 55 to 64 years were identified from population registries and randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to receive either an invitation to undergo a single colonoscopy screening (invited group) or no invitation to screening (usual care group).  Individuals were randomly assigned before they were asked whether they wanted to participate in the trial.  Except for the 6,900 participants from Norway, participants in the usual-care group were not informed of their enrollment in the trial. The primary end points were risk of developing CRC and CRC-related death. The secondary end point was death from any cause.</Para><Para id="_435">Data were reported for 84,585 participants in Poland, Norway, and Sweden: 28,220 in the invited group, of whom 42% underwent screening, and 56,365 in the usual-care group. Opportunistic colonoscopy screening activity was monitored in the trial regions, and no additional colonoscopy procedures were identified beyond what would have been expected for clinical indications, indicating minimal, if any, contamination in the usual-care group.  Hence, this trial compared colonoscopy screening with no screening. After a median follow-up of 10 years, in intention-to-screen analyses, the risk of developing CRC was 0.98% in the invited group and 1.20% in the usual-care group (risk ratio,  0.82; 95% CI, 0.70–0.93). The risk of death from CRC was 0.28% in the invited group and 0.31% in the usual-care group (risk ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.64–1.16). The risk of death from any cause was 11.03% in the invited group and 11.04% in the usual-care group (risk ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96–1.04). Since only 42% of invited participants underwent screening, adjusted analyses were performed to estimate the effect of screening if all participants randomly assigned to screening actually had been screened. The risk ratio for CRC was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.55–0.83), and the risk ratio for CRC-related death was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.27–0.77). Fifteen participants had major bleeding after polyp removal, and there were no perforations or screening-related deaths within 30 days after colonoscopy.<Reference refidx="43"/></Para><Para id="_436">Caveats for this trial include the following:</Para><OrderedList id="_437" Style="Arabic">

Some case-control results are available. The <Strong>sensitivity</Strong> of a CRC screening test for adenomas (and for CRC) may be helpful in considering its possible clinical usefulness, given that there are no completed RCTs of the impact of colonoscopy on CRC mortality or incidence. Colonoscopy is commonly considered the <Strong>gold standard</Strong> because it directly assesses the physical presence of lesions in the colon.  However, colonoscopy can miss roughly 10% of cancers and advanced adenomas because of suboptimal bowel cleansing, lesions being hidden behind <Strong>folds</Strong> (or haustra) in the colon, or suboptimal examination by the endoscopist.

In one study, there were differences among gastroenterologists  in the rates of detection of adenomas (range of the mean number of lesions per patient screened, 0.10–1.05; range of the percentage of patients with adenomas, 9.4%–23.7%) and the times of withdrawal of the scope (3.1–16.8 minutes for procedures not including polyp removal).  Examiners whose mean withdrawal time was 6 minutes or more had higher detection rates than those with mean withdrawal times of less than 6 minutes (28.3% vs. 11.8%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001 for any neoplasia and 6.4% vs. 2.6%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt;    .005 for advanced neoplasia).<Reference refidx="45"/></Para><Para id="_352">In the first 10 years of the German CRC screening program, detection of nonadvanced adenomas increased in men from 13.3% to 22.3% and in women from 8.4% to 14.9%.

The detection of advanced adenomas and CRC increased by a much smaller amount.<Reference refidx="46"/></Para><Para id="_353">  Overall detection rates of adenomas and cancer may be affected by how thoroughly endoscopists search for flat adenomas and flat cancer.                                      While the phenomenon of   flat neoplasms  has been appreciated for years in Japan, it has more recently been described in the United States.  In a study in which endoscopists used high-resolution white-light endoscopes, flat or nonpolypoid lesions accounted for only 11% of all superficial colon lesions, but these flat or nonpolypoid lesions were about 9.8 times as likely as polypoid lesions to contain cancer (<Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> neoplasia or invasive cancer).<Reference refidx="35"/>           However, because the definition of <Strong>flat</Strong> or  <Strong>nonpolypoid</Strong> was height less than one-half                           of the diameter,    it is likely that many lesions classified as  nonpolypoid   in this study would be routinely found and described by U.S. endoscopists as <Strong>sessile</Strong>.     The existence of very flat or depressed lesions—depressed lesions are very uncommon but highly likely to contain cancer—requires that endoscopists pay more attention to this problem.<Reference refidx="47"/>   Flat lesions may play a role in the phenomenon of missed cancers.<Reference refidx="48"/></Para><Para id="_304">A health maintenance organization assessed the impact of ADRs in follow-up after 314,872 colonoscopies performed from 1998 to 2010 by 136 gastroenterologists, each of whom had done at least 300 colonoscopies during that period.  The goal was to determine rates of interval CRC, interval advanced CRC, and CRC death and to relate those rates to a gastroenterologist’s ADR.   There were 712 interval cancers (155 advanced) and 147 CRC deaths.  The risk of interval cancer from lowest-to-highest quintile of ADR was 9.8, 8.6, 8.0, 7.0, and 4.8 per 10,000 person-years of follow-up.   The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for physicians in the highest quintile compared with those in the lowest quintile was 0.52 for any interval CRC, 0.43 for advanced CRC, and 0.38 for fatal CRC.  Each 1.0% increase in ADR was associated with a 3% decrease in risk of cancer, although the CI for each quintile was broad.  Limitations of the study include the inability to determine which specific feature of ADR led to reduced interval cancer. For example, it is unclear whether it was due to the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_305" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>	Removal of small adenomas that may grow rapidly to become CRC.</ListItem><ListItem> ADR being a surrogate outcome for an endoscopist’s ability to remove adenomas more completely.</ListItem><ListItem>	ADR being a surrogate outcome for an endoscopist’s ability to better detect large, flat, serrated lesions.</ListItem><ListItem>	Higher ADR leading to recommendations for more frequent postpolypectomy surveillance colonoscopy.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_306">Another limitation is that the harms of a colonoscopy associated with ADR could not be measured.<Reference refidx="49"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_340"><Title>Nonrandomized controlled trial evidence about colorectal cancer incidence or mortality reduction</Title><Para id="_345">Although there is little RCT evidence to assess reduction of CRC incidence or mortality by colonoscopy, some case-control evidence is available.<Reference refidx="50"/>  Based on case-control data about sigmoidoscopy, noted above, there was speculation that protection for the right colon might be similar to that for the left colon. A 2009 case-control study of colonoscopy raised questions about whether the impact of colonoscopy on proximal lesions might be different than the impact on distal lesions.<Reference refidx="51"/> Using a province-wide administrative database in Ontario, Canada, investigators compared cases of individuals who were diagnosed with CRC from 1996 to 2001 and had died by 2003.  Controls were selected from persons who did not die of CRC.  Billing claims were used to assess exposure to previous colonoscopy.  The OR for the association between complete colonoscopy and distal lesions was 0.33, suggesting a substantial mortality reduction.  For proximal lesions, however, the OR of 0.99 indicated virtually no mortality reduction. However,  this study had limited data about whether examinations were complete to the cecum and about bowel prep.  Further, many endoscopists were not gastroenterologists.</Para><Para id="_341">A case-control study assessed CRC reduction (but not CRC mortality reduction) in the right side versus the left side of the colon.  In a population-based study from Germany using data from administrative and medical records, 1,688 patients with CRC were compared with 1,932 participants without CRC, aged 50 years or older.<Reference refidx="52"/>  Data were collected about demographics, risk factors, and previous screening examinations.  According to colonoscopy records, the cecum was reached 91% of the time.  Colonoscopy in the previous 10    years was associated with an OR for any CRC of 0.23, for proximal CRC of 0.44, and for distal CRC of 0.16.  While this study did not assess CRC mortality, the results suggested that the magnitude of the right-side versus the left-side difference may be smaller than previously found.<Reference refidx="51"/>  It would be extremely useful to assess right-side versus left-side differences in a RCT.</Para><Para id="_346">Other case-control data suggest a reduction of CRC incidence on the right side of about 64% compared with about 74% on the left side.<Reference refidx="53"/></Para><Para id="_347">Because there is little RCT evidence and case-control evidence is limited, it is important to consider the degree of mortality reduction from colonoscopy. While a figure of 90% is sometimes cited as the degree of mortality reduction,<Reference refidx="54"/> the question will not be properly answered until the completion of European RCT that has a control group of <Strong>routine care</Strong> that involves minimal screening of any kind.<Reference refidx="55"/> Reliable results from colonoscopy RCTs are needed to confirm the studies of FS that suggest a mortality reduction of approximately 50% might occur in the right colon, similar to the demonstrated impact of FS in the left colon.  This generalization is limited by a number of factors, including that proximal lesions may have a different pathology (e.g., a serrated appearance and different molecular pathway).</Para><Para id="_431">The benefit of continued CRC screening after age 75 years is uncertain. An observational cohort study with the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) sought to determine whether CRC mortality or morbidity was affected by lower endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) screening in individuals older than 75 years, based on a person’s age, comorbidity, family history of CRC, and screening history.  Individuals were followed from 1988 to 2016 and had follow-up questionnaires every 2 years, with a 90% response rate.  Among over 50,000 individuals, there were 661 CRCs and 323 CRC-related deaths.  Screening after age 75 years was associated with reduced CRC incidence (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51–0.74) and CRC-related mortality (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.46–0.78), regardless of screening history.  It is not clear exactly what <Strong>past screening history</Strong> meant, however—i.e., the number and results of exams before age 75 years (no polyps; or some polyps indicating increased future risk).  The study also assessed the relation of comorbidity to benefit and found that individuals with serious comorbidity—defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or three comorbidities (high blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia)—did not benefit from screening.   Although observational and not an RCT, this study likely provides the best-available data for a scenario in which a formal RCT is unlikely to be performed. It suggests that healthy people older than 75 years may benefit from continued CRC screening and reduction in mortality and morbidity.<Reference refidx="56"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_46"><Title>Virtual Colonoscopy (Computed Tomographic Colonography [CTC])</Title><Para id="_73">Virtual colonoscopy (also known as  CTC or CT pneumocolon) refers to the examination of computer-generated images of the colon constructed from data obtained from an abdominal  CT scan. These images simulate the effect of a conventional colonoscopy. Patients must take laxatives to clean the colon before the procedure, and the colon is insufflated with air (sometimes carbon dioxide) by insertion of a rectal tube just before radiographic examination.<Reference refidx="57"/></Para><Para id="_157">The American College of Radiology Imaging Network group conducted a large, paired-design study, with 2,531 participants at average risk (prevalence of polyps or cancer  ≥10 mm,   4%; mean age, about 58 years) screened with both CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC). The gold standard was the OC, including repeat OC exams for people with lesions found by CTC but not by OC. Of 109 people with at least one adenoma or cancer 10 mm or larger, 98 (90%) were detected by CTC (referring everyone with a CTC lesion of ≥5 mm). Specificity was 86%, and PPV was 23%.

This cross-sectional study suggested that virtual colonoscopy might be an acceptable screening or surveillance test for individuals at high risk of CRC, but it did not address outcome or frequency of testing in those at high risk.</Para><Para id="_97">Some studies have assessed how well virtual colonoscopy can detect colorectal polyps without a laxative prep.  The question is of great importance for implementation because the laxative prep required by both conventional colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy is considered a great disadvantage by patients.  By tagging feces with iodinated contrast material ingested for several days before the procedure, investigators in one study  were able to detect lesions larger than 8 mm with 95% sensitivity and 92% specificity.<Reference refidx="60"/>   The particular tagging material used in this study caused about 10% of patients to become nauseated; however, other materials are being assessed.  </Para><Para id="_238">Another study <Reference refidx="61"/> used a low-fiber diet, orally ingested contrast, and "electronic cleansing," a process that subtracts tagged feces. CTC identified 91% of adenomas 10 mm or larger, but it detected fewer (70%) lesions of at least 8 mm. Patients who received both CTC and OC preferred CTC to OC (290 vs. 175). This study shows that CTC without a laxative prep detects small 1-cm lesions with high sensitivity and is acceptable to patients. Long-term utilization of CTC will depend on several issues, including the frequency of follow-up exams that would be needed to detect smaller lesions that were undetected and may grow over time.</Para><Para id="_77">Extracolonic abnormalities are commonly detected with CTC. Fifteen percent of patients in an Australian series of 100 patients, referred for colonography because of symptoms or family history, were found to have extracolonic findings, and 11% of the patients needed further medical workups for renal, splenic, uterine, liver, and gallbladder abnormalities.<Reference refidx="62"/> In another study, 59%  of 111 symptomatic patients referred for clinical colonoscopy in a Swedish hospital between June 1998 and September 1999 were found to have moderate or major extracolonic conditions on CTC. CTC was  performed immediately before a colonoscopy,  and these findings required further evaluation. The extent to which follow-up of these incidental findings benefited patients is unknown.<Reference refidx="63"/>    </Para><Para id="_82">Sixty-nine percent of  681 asymptomatic patients in Minnesota had extracolonic findings, 10% of which were deemed highly important by the investigators; these patients required further medical workup.

Two other studies, one large (N = 2,195) and one small (n = 136) examined the moderate or high importance of extracolonic findings from CTC. The larger study <Reference refidx="65"/> found that 8.6% of patients had an extracolonic finding of at least moderate importance, while 24% of patients in the smaller study <Reference refidx="66"/> required some evaluation for an extracolonic finding.  The larger study found nine cancers from these evaluations, at a partial cost (they did not include all costs) of $98.56 per patient initially screened.  The smaller study found no important lesions from evaluation, at a cost of $248 per person screened.  Both of these estimates of cost are higher than previous studies have found.  The extent to which any patients benefited from the detection of extracolonic findings is not clear.  Because both studies were conducted in academic medical centers, the generalizability to other settings is also not clear.  Neither of these studies examined the effect of extracolonic findings on patient anxiety and psychological function.</Para><Para id="_78">Technical improvements involving both the interpretation methodology, such as three-dimensional (3-D) imaging, and bowel preparation are under study in many centers.

For example, if a subgroup of young women were to have a substantially lower risk of proximal neoplasms, then recommending sigmoidoscopy instead of colonoscopy  might lead to higher compliance (the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends both procedures without preference, as part of a program of screening those at average risk).</Para><Para id="_350">In a study to identify an average-risk group who had a higher versus lower risk of advanced neoplasia (CRC and advanced adenomas) anywhere in the colon, 2,993 individuals having a screening colonoscopy were stratified by age, sex, waist circumference, smoking, and family history (those in high-risk family categories, e.g., Lynch syndrome or adenomatous polyposis coli, were excluded).  In a classification system derived in a training set, the risks of advanced neoplasm in four groups were: 1.92%, 4.88%, 9.93%, and 24%.  In the two lowest-risk groups, sigmoidoscopy would have detected 51 (73%) of 70 advanced neoplasms.  In the independent validation set, results were similar.  Whether this system increases overall compliance has yet to be determined.<Reference refidx="80"/></Para><Para id="_351">A similar stratification system based on age, sex, smoking, and family history—and combined with FIT—was tested in Asia to determine whether use of the stratification system plus FIT could detect which people needed colonoscopy.  If either the stratification system or FIT was positive, a person was recommended for colonoscopy.  Using this strategy, 95% of those with CRC were correctly told to have colonoscopy.<Reference refidx="81"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="17253456">Hewitson P, Glasziou P, Irwig L, et al.: Screening for colorectal cancer using the faecal occult blood test, Hemoccult.

The magnitude of harms is a combination of the frequency and severity of harm, as perceived by the patient.</Para><Para id="_309">Harms are defined broadly as any negative effect on individuals or populations resulting from being involved in the screening process (cascade) compared with not screening. Potential harms are organized according to the type of harm (e.g., physical, psychological, and hassle/opportunity costs) and when they occur in the screening cascade (e.g., screening test/workup; screening test/workup results; surveillance and surveillance results; and early treatment and overtreatment).  For example, potential harms of screening colonoscopy include harms of the screening test itself (e.g., perforation and bleeding), results of the screening test (e.g., anxiety from an abnormal result), surveillance (e.g., harms of more frequent colonoscopies), and treatment (e.g., earlier treatment or overtreatment). Harms are also associated with the workup for other colorectal cancer screening tests (e.g., colonoscopy for positive fecal occult blood test [FOBT]).  A recent study of three major hospitals found that 71% of endoscopes tested positive for bacteria after cleaning and high-level disinfection of the scopes.

Colonic perforation and serious bleeding occur more often with biopsy or polypectomy, with an overall average of three to five serious complications per 1,000 procedures.  The physical harm of discomfort during the procedure has been reduced by sedation, although sedation has its own potential for physical harm (magnitude and severity uncertain because of insufficient evidence).</Para><Para id="_313">Physical harms are also associated with further steps in the screening cascade. These harms include diagnosis of CRC (some large ecological studies have shown an increase in suicide soon after diagnosis) and overdiagnosis/overtreatment due to treating lesions that would never have caused the patient important problems (evidence insufficient to determine magnitude and severity).</Para><Para id="_314">The potential psychological harms of colonoscopy include anticipation of the procedure and anxiety while awaiting the results of biopsy reports. For people with polyps, there may be increased distress in considering oneself at increased risk of CRC (evidence insufficient).  For people newly diagnosed with CRC, many will experience increased anxiety and depression for at least 6 months, as prognosis and treatment are discussed (evidence insufficient).</Para><Para id="_315">The harm of time/effort and opportunity costs involved in moving through the demands of the screening cascade are present throughout the process (evidence insufficient to determine frequency and severity).</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_316"><Title>FOBT/immunochemical FOBT (FIT)</Title><Para id="_317">The potential physical harms of fecal-based testing include the same harms as for colonoscopy for people with a positive test who have been referred for diagnostic colonoscopy. </Para><Para id="_318">The potential psychological harms, as well as time/effort and opportunity costs are also similar to the description above for colonoscopy (for more information, see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062753#_311" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-screening-pdq">Colonoscopy</SummaryRef> section in Evidence of Harms).<Reference refidx="8"/>  These harms are associated with moving through the screening cascade, regardless of the initial screening test.
