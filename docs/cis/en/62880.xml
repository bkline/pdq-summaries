has risen markedly for the past two decades. Adenocarcinoma is now more prevalent
than squamous cell carcinomas in the United States and Western Europe, with most

squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma is the strong association
between GERD and adenocarcinoma.  The results
of a population-based case-controlled study suggest that symptomatic
gastroesophageal reflux is a risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.  The
frequency, severity, and duration of reflux symptoms were positively associated
with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.<Reference refidx="1"/> In a case-control  study from Sweden, the odds ratio (OR) was 7.7 for patients with recurrent reflux symptoms,  while the OR for patients with long-standing and severe symptoms was 43.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.3–103.5).<Reference refidx="1"/> A meta-analysis of 1,128 individuals with esophageal adenocarcinoma from five case-control studies reported statistically significant increases in risk with recurrent heartburn (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 3.3–6.6), regurgitation (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 3.4–6.1), or both (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 3.4–6.8). Daily heartburn and regurgitation was associated with an eightfold increase in risk (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 4.5–14.0).<Reference refidx="2"/> The probable mechanism is that long-standing GERD is associated with the development of Barrett esophagus, a condition in which an abnormal intestinal-type epithelium replaces the stratified squamous epithelium that normally lines the distal esophagus. Barrett esophagus is considered a precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma.<Reference refidx="3"/> The intestinal-type epithelium of Barrett
esophagus has a characteristic endoscopic appearance that differs from squamous
epithelium.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Dysplasia in Barrett epithelium represents a neoplastic
alteration of the columnar epithelium that may progress to invasive
adenocarcinoma.<Reference refidx="5"/> </Para><Para id="_243">A population-based cohort study in Sweden showed that patients with Barrett esophagus developed adenocarcinoma of the esophagus at about 1.2 cases per 1,000 person-years of follow-up monitoring, which is about 11.3 times higher than in the general population.  Thus, while the relative risk may be elevated, the absolute risk is still not high.

Among patients with low-grade dysplasia, eradication of dysplasia occurred in 90.5% of the treatment group, compared with 22.7% in the control group. In the high-grade dysplasia group, rates were 81.0% in the treatment group, compared with 19.0% in the control group.  Additionally, 77.4% of patients in the ablation group had complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia, compared with 2.3% in the control group.

The complication rate was relatively low. Among 84 treated patients, there was one upper gastrointestinal  hemorrhage and five strictures that were easily treated.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_251">This study suggests that the treatment of patients with Barrett esophagus and dysplasia may ablate Barrett esophagus and prevent disease progression. However, the study provides only weak evidence about whether treatment reduces the outcome of esophageal cancer (because it was not designed to answer that question).  Evidence from the study suggests that ablation does not simply coagulate and hide dangerous cells under the surface of the esophagus (those cells could later evolve to cancer).  A question entirely separate from this study is whether patients should be screened for Barrett esophagus (this study focused on the treatment of patients with Barrett esophagus who had been identified as having dysplasia). Furthermore, the study does not discuss    the net benefits and harms of an overall program of screening (e.g.,  screening of patients with GERD or certain GERD symptoms) and the surveillance of patients with Barrett esophagus.       The potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment may be considerable  if physicians used results of this study to treat patients with Barrett esophagus and no dysplasia.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="10080844" MedlineID="99165315">Lagergren J, Bergström R, Lindgren A, et al.: Symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux as a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma.
